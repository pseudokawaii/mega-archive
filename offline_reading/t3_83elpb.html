<p>Rutger Hauer plays Nick Randall, the great-grandson of Josh Randall and also a bounty hunter in Los Angeles, and, yeah, it's a bummer that there weren't enough connections or references made to tie in with Steve McQueen's character. Nick Randall is a loner, and he's looking to make a big enough score so that he can fix up his grungy boat. But then his past comes back to bite him.</p>
<p>Gene Simmons, from the band KISS, back then was trying to branch out from white make-up and from sticking out his tongue, and, in the '80s he took on a few villainous roles. Here, Gene brings understated menace to the screen as Middle Eastern terrorist Malak Al Rahim, although Gene never does end up sounding Middle Eastern. Malak Al Rahim arrives in L.A. and soon blows up a movie theater, and then vows to unleash even more terror on the city.</p></p>
