    <strong>[MUSIC] Discographies 'Godspeed You Black Emperor!' [FLAC] & 'Silver Mt. Zion' [FLAC] [2 EPs only as MP3] | 4.3GB</strong>
    <p><p>The two sister bands "Godspeed You Black Emperor!" (and their spelling variants) and "A Silver Mt. Zion" (and their even more exhaustive spelling variants) is one of the most unique collectives in the experimental music genre. If you've never heard of them, they are to Post-Rock what Radiohead is to slightly more regular Rock.</p>
<p>The harrowingly beautiful leads into the graciously bombastic via distorted soundscapes of post-industrial apocalypses and soul-crushingly gallant glimmers of ethereal hope.</p>
<p>The Silver Mt. Zion discography is unfortunately missing two EPs as FLAC, I could only find them as MP3: "The West Will Rise Again" (2012) &amp; "Hang On to Each Other" (2014). <strong>If anyone here has them, or would be willing to digitize their vinyls</strong> (I know some of you out there surely have them), I would be especially happy about "Hang On to Each Other" in high quality. Drop me a line, would ya?</p>

        <p>YES!  Fantastic post! I had GYBE on my list of things to upload and you beat me to it - plus you have way <em>way</em> more Silver Mt Zion than I would have been able to post.  Grabbing all the Zion albums that I don't have.</p>
<p>Thanks man, this is awesome!</p>

        <p>I see you just posted Nujabes. I think our respective music archives would really like to fornicate with each other.</p>
<p>(A couple of months ago I played a DJ set at a chill-out floor, and during the funky jazzy hiphop phase of that set - it was a very long set, almost 8 hours - I played the remix of Jamiroquai's Canned Heat that Nujabes put on his Ristorante Mixtape)</p>

        <p>ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, the west will rise again in flac!!! Awesome. Good on'ya. Now my collection is properly finished. Back in May 2017, all flac files I could find were in a torrent. Reluctantly (I do not like torrents), I went for it. However, I could never find this ep. Now you did it. Good on'ya.</p>
<p>By the way, this seems to be the most appropriate place for this. If you guys can like gybe and Silver Mt. Zion (I love it, but for instance, my partner does not like Efrim when he sings. Weirdly, I do not want even Thom Yorke having a go at it.), you probably may like some other stuff. If you like this post, I believe you may like Pink Floyd, Roger Waters, Arvo Part, a bit of Mogwai, perhaps even B. Fleischmann (he was responsible for the soundtrack of the 2013 doco Der Banker: Master of the Universe). There may be others. I will upload my library of those in the future.</p>
<p>I stumbled on gybe first, because of 28 Days Later. I downloaded that soundtrack, but the single music I was looking for was not there. I had to run through the credits to hunt for that gybe gem. Then I asked the question: "do they have anything else interesting?" Then I loved "Dead Flag Blues", and after "Storm" (back then I used e-mule, downloading single files, haphazardly), I ended up starting my collection then. After a while, when they were not releasing anything after Yanqui UXO, I iterated that same question, and arrived at Silver Mt. Zion. How can someone with ears not fall in love with "Sisters! Brothers! Small Boats Of Fire Are Falling From The Sky!"??? Then there is "Movie (Never Made)". This one is not that much interesting, but the lyrics, oh boy. Many times I imagine that imagery, and it always steals tears. I may be called a misanthrope, but this song gives me hope. Imagine the whole world singing this one, eh???? This band's lyrics are truly relevant as another instrument altogether. There you go, I succumbed to the irresistible compulsion of getting their discography as well. And what a find! Indeed, there are some that are acquired taste, but all in all, it is hard to fault one song in their whole work.
Iterating again the same question, you may find "Shalabi Effect". This one takes some effort to go through. The easier ones are "Kinder Surprise", "Bright Guilty World", "Vegas Radiation", an maybe others. Regardless, maybe you may like this one. I will upload those as well in the future.</p>
