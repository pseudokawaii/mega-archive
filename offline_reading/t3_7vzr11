<p>From YouTube Description:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is nothing more than a PARODY-REMIX, please support the official release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods – CZ Edition is a soundtrack/score edit project I decided to do after watching a few clips on YouTube of people adding in music from the Faulconer Productions (Bruce Faulconer, Julius Dobos, Budd Guin, Ben Kasparek, Scott Morgan &amp; Mike Smith) soundtrack/score of FUNimation’s Dragon Ball Z dub to the first DBZ movie in ages, Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods. The music many of us grew up with in the late 90’s and early 00’s. I thought, “It’d be really cool if someone did this in the highest quality…and right…for the <em>entire movie</em>. That would be so freaking cool, especially for us fans that grew up with that dub.” So, I did. And then some. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I say anything else, I want to make it clear: I am a fan of both scores, both dubs, Japanese and English, the show’s original Japanese score, the show’s FUNimation produced score, the movie’s original score, everything. This is NOT meant to start another war in the comments about which score or soundtrack is better. I did this as a fun project because there’s always demand (nostalgia-driven, yes) from a lot of people who grew up with this music while experiencing the series for the first time on Cartoon Network’s Toonami block or the subsequent DVD releases. I didn’t do this in spite of the original score or in disregard for it; I did it so that all of us that grew up with this style of Dragon Ball Z can re-experience it again through this movie with <em>another version</em> of BoG. A re-scored version that caters to American (and even global) fans of Dragon Ball Z that started watching it when Cartoon Network’s Toonami block was first airing FUNimation’s original dub of the series, when the Dragon Ball Z and anime phenomenon spread in America. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are fun bits I added for the all-around Dragon Ball fan, this isn’t just a Faulconer Productions edition…it “is”, but it’s slightly more than that. If you’re even more <em>”classic old-school dub”</em> you’ll be pleased to see that I added the <em>true original dub’s</em>, the Ocean Dub’s, theme song: "Main Title" &amp; "End Title"…better known as "Rock the Dragon" into this edit (because nothing screams DBZ nostalgia for me, and probably you, like hearing “Rock the Dragon”). I also paid homage to the original Japanese score with "Makafushigi Adventure!" in a bright and funny way throughout the movie. And once again if you love the original Japanese score -and honestly if you’re a Dragon Ball fan in general-, you’re going to love the credits, I had fun with what I inserted in there (it syncs up perfectly with the end). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So please, sit down and watch, enjoy and share. I’ve put many hours and nights into this, play it loud! If you have headphones and like to watch with those, please do and blast it! If the response for this goes well and there’s demand I might consider making a ‘CZ Edition’ (aka Faulconer Productions soundtrack/score edit) for <em>Resurrection ‘F’</em> and eventually even the new series <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>. Speaking of, HOW CRAZY IS IT THAT WE’RE GETTING NEW MOVIES AND A NEW SERIES OF DRAGON BALL IN 2015 GUYS?! It’s pretty crazy. </p>

        <p>As a concept, this was an awesome idea, and the execution is good. My only gripe with it is that there seems to be flickering all throughout the audio, especially in parts where they're talking without any music in the background. It's not bad enough to ruin it entirely, but it's not something that can be easily ignored either.</p>
