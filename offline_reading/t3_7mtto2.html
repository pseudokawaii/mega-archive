<p>A legendary stock car racer (Rory Calhoun) is fast on the track and faster with the women in his life, leading to action on and off the speedway. Calhoun is forced to retire after a nasty crash that left one leg permanently injured. With nothing much to do, Calhoun takes a young garage owner, John Gentry, under his wing and teaches the eager mechanic how to race. Gentry soon becomes obsessed with racing and practically forces his beautiful wife, Connie Hines (Mister Ed), into Calhoun s arms after he (Gentry) has become smitten with a racetrack groupie. Realizing that he has made a mistake, Calhoun cooks up a plan to snap Gentry back to reality, and reunite him with his wife. Alan Hale Jr. (Gilligan s Island s beloved The Skipper ) is the happy-go-lucky mechanic. Filmed on the same South Carolina track as Tom Cruise s Days of Thunder thirty years later the Southern 500 is considered the World Series of Stock Car Racing. Appearances by: Buck Baker, Joe Caspolich, Neil Castles, Sr., Joe Eubanks, Shep Langdon, Francis Thompson, Curtis Turner, Joe Weatherly. </p></p>
