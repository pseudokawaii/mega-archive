    <strong>[EXTRAS] Deadpool DVD-EXTRAS ONLY (720p) (2016)</strong>
    <p><p><a href="http://mega.nz/#F!lEQEhZrI">LINK</a></p>
<p>KEY: !mGfDfb-5fjBNT5V06UKRGw (just a security measure. paste it in when it asks)</p>
<p><strong>INCLUDES EXTRAS ONLY:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deleted/Extended scenes (One major unused scene that was planned to be used as well as a few clips and an extended version of the highway scene from memory)</li>
<li>Gag reel (Bloopers)</li>
<li>From Comics To Screen...To Screen (Hour-long behind-the-scenes documentary/interview kind of thing.)</li>
<li>Previz and Stuntviz (Early, unrendered test footage of what would eventually become the CG and stunts in the finished product)</li>
<li>Trailers, Fun Sack and Other Stuff (Includes a satirical interview with Reynolds, all of the trailers for the film and a guide for detecting cancer presented by Deadpool himself)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, <strong>the commentary is not included as I couldn't find a copy</strong>, if anyone has it and wants to link it that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>There are links to extras here but one was a package deal and the other was Joybell's (so useless for a lot of people who don't want to waste their data and can't play x265) and the extras only link got removed anyway so I decided to upload my copy</p>
<p>It's not the highest quality but it's the best I could find for extras and x264</p>
<p>Release is MKVCage's</p>
<p>I'm not certain about the system on submitting extras only since I haven't seen any uploads that way so I'm peddling the fact that it ONLY HAS THE EXTRAS, NOT THE MOVIE INCLUDED to avoid confusion. If you want the movie just search for it/use the Movie and Extras package <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/megalinks/comments/4hy4tm/movie_deadpool_2016_with_extras/">here</a> instead.</p></p>
