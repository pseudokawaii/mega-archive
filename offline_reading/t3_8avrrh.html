    <strong>[TV] 48 Hours: Missing Marsha (4/7/18) [360p WEBRip | x264 | AAC] [260MB]</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Was a missing Tennessee woman murdered or did she willingly disappear?</strong><br>
<strong>A 50-year-old woman vanishes and for months nobody reports her missing -- then a most unlikely amateur sleuth pushes authorities to look into the case</strong>  </p>
<p>When Marsha Brantley, 50, of Cleveland, Tenn., suddenly vanished in 2009, her husband Donnie eventually became a suspect in her murder. But was Marsha even dead?  </p>
<p>The case was unusual from the start because for months after Marsha disappeared, nobody reported her missing â€“ not her friends, her family or even her husband.  No one took much notice until her hairdresser, Kelly DeLude, worried about a missed appointment and started asking questions.  </p>
<p>"I felt compelled to find out what happened to her," DeLude tells "48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant. "I wasn't trying to be a detective. I was trying to be a concerned friend."  </p>
<p>DeLude eventually called police, and investigators later picked up the case.  </p>
