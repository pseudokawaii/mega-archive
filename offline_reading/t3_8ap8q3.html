<p>Jane Berry (Nancy McKeon) was a high-powered, single career woman before being knocked unconscious in a car accident on Christmas Eve. When she wakes up, she s told that she s a married stay-at-home mom with two children. After spending time with her family, Jane finds that she likes the loving wife and mother she has become, though she has no recollection of how she got there. The LIFETIME Original Movie COMFORT AND JOY also stars Steven Eckholdt as Jane s husband, and Dixie Carter as her feisty mother, Frederica, who is constantly meddling in her daughter s life.</p></p>
