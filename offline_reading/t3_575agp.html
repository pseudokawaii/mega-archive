<p>Armando Iannucci is the writer and producer of some of the best comedy ever released, including The Day Today, Alan Partridge, The Thick Of It, and Veep.</p>
<p>Time Trumpet is set in the year 2031 and is a retrospective documentary on the first thirty years of the 21st century. Actors and actresses played the parts of 'today's stars' thirty years on, who were interviewed as part of the show. The show also included interviews with comedians, billed in the show as "top cultural commentators slash TV pundits", speaking about the events of the past.</p>
<p>Each episode had a main theme running throughout, such as The Olympics or the War in Iraq. The main running gag was the promise of a catch up with "an increasingly odd Tom Cruise" and would feature the elderly actor making bizarre claims such as to be "pound for pound the world's strongest man".</p>
<p>The Armando Iannucci Shows is a series of eight programmes, each of which is focused on specific themes relating to human nature and existentialism, around which Iannucci would weave a series of surreal sketches and monologues.</p>
<p>Recurring themes in the episodes are the superficiality of modern culture, our problems communicating with each other, the mundane nature of working life and feelings of personal inadequacy and social awkwardness. Several characters also make repeat appearances in the shows, including the East End thug, who solves every problem with threats of violence; Hugh, an old man who delivers surreal monologues about what things were like in the old days; and Iannucci's barber, who is full of nonsensical anecdotes.</p>
