<p>Dan Carlin has the last 12 episodes for free on the RSS feed and wherever you get your podcasts from. I highly suggest listening to them there, it would help his show very much. The other episodes are behind a paywall, so I have them uploaded on Mega. If you want to listen to the free episodes, i have them below.</p>

        <p>I totally agree. I feel kinda bad for pirating his show. I enjoyed his episodes almost everyday on the way to uni, but back then I couldn't afford to pay for the older episodes, so I pirated them. I will pay for the episodes soon, but until then, this has to suffice. </p>

        <p>Go whine somewhere else, please. </p>
<p>Some of us don't have the privilege of having a bank account or any kind of card to make electronic transactions. I am homeless and have been unemployed since my divorce six years ago. The state took away my driver's license - they do that in real life - and since then I can't prove I am who I am with financial institutions - or voting authorities, oddly enough. Cash is all I can deal with, and no matter how hard I stick cash into my computer, it doesn't go anywhere.</p>
<p>It guarantees no employer will hire me, and I've been in and out of jails and prisons about a dozen times, because I can't afford all the "contempt of court" trials. Yet I downloaded and contributed to his podcast since he started it, when I was married and owned businesses and could afford it, and it was a lot more than $2. That's right, you put the dollar sign in front of the number. I don't see any difference from me telling other people about his show and putting some episodes on a piece of media to encourage them to listen.</p>
<p>I've had his shows on a hard drive for more than 10 years. But some episodes I've been missing, and I'm glad I can finally hear the Punic Nightmares series once again. I think I did a lot more than you in giving the guy money when I could. But I thank the poster.</p>
<p>Don't like stuff "pirated"? What are you doing here then? Sod off.</p>
