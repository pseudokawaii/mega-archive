    <strong>All New Members Stop By Here First</strong>
    <p><p>Hi &amp; welcome to /r/megalinks, first thing, please scroll down on your right &amp; read our rules &amp; follow them while you're here.<br>
Before making a request use the search bar on the top right of the page to see if someone may have already posted what you're looking for. And make sure what you want is even available online, just because it's been released in theaters doesn't mean it's available online yet.<br>
Now if you're completely new to downloading files from Mega:<br>
[HOW TO DOWNLOAD:]
(https://youtu.be/26vrLw9hmIg?t=30s)<br>
A lot of our files are in .rar format which is a compression method to make a file smaller for uploading, you will need an extraction program to unzip the files, such as [Winrar] (http://www.rarlabs.com/download.htm) or [7-Zip] (http://www.7-zip.org/download.html).<br>
Most times it will be just 1 file, but for bigger 1080p releases &amp; some apps the files have been broken into smaller files for easier downloading, if that's the case with your download, double click 1 of the files, when winrar opens click on extract to &amp; choose where you want your files to go, once the extraction is complete you will have your movie or app, now you can then delete all the .rar files. If you need video help: [Watch Here.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5lNCkcLlc0)<br>
Also lastly when posting be sure to follow rule [4.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/megalinks/comments/5rolb0/meta_4_formatting_of_the_title/)  </p>
