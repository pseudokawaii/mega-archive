    <strong>[DOCUMENTARY] After the Escape: Finding Home in a Foreign Land (2017 Deutsche Welle DocFilms) [720p WEBRip | x264 | 96 AAC] [808MB]</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Refugees have long used art and culture to make new homes for themselves in foreign lands. This stretches not only them, but their host country too. A film about five refugees and how books, movies and music can become key tools for integration.</strong>  </p>
<p>"Isn’t it wonderful to be a refugee?" ten-year-old Judith Kerr shouted across the rooftops of Paris in 1934. She and her family had fled Nazi Germany one year earlier. Escape was a great adventure for her and her parents didn’t let her sense their own fear. Today, the world-famous 94-year-old writer ("When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit") lives in London and says: "For me, England was my home at the end of the war. But it wasn’t for my parents. They never belonged anywhere." It’s a story typical of many refugee families. The stories of the other protagonists show how integration can succeed and how it can fail. Syrian pianist Aeham Ahmad, German-Bosnian writer Saša Stanišić, Nigerian-German musician Nneka Egbuna and Chilean author and director Antonio Skármeta all came to Germany, which has been a refuge for many persecuted artists and artists since the end of the Second World War. The documentary lets them tell their stories - and shows how immigrants have enriched art, culture and society in Germany.  </p>
