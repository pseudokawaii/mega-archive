<p>EDIT: I've liked the first movie since the day it was released, corny as it is, but damn those things are a prime case for ditching a highly complex foot army using ballistic weaponry and instead using a simple biological or chemical weapon from orbit.  One ship and one bomb vs what we saw in the movie.  </p>
<p>Obviously they can catch bugs live as per the combat effectiveness clip so how hard would it be to find a bio/chem weakness and create a high-altitude detonating device to exploit it?</p>
<p>Simple astrophysics would allow a release from so far away the bugs would never even know the ship was there.  A month or two for the bomb/bombs to coast until high atmosphere contact.  Dispersal of the agent into the jetstreams and a casing designed to quickly oxidise and degrade on contact with a prevalent gas in the atmosphere and there would not even be a trace of the operation for the Brain bugs to find.  </p>
<p>Six months later the world would be almost free of infestation and then you send in the marines to mop up the few remaining pockets that escaped the agent.</p>

        <p>It's very different to the movie, but it goes into a lot more detail about tactics and why the MI exists. The short version is: Nukes (and chemical weapons, etc.) are great if you just want to completely destroy an enemy, but sometimes you want to pick their biggest city, destroy 35% of it's industrial capacity, 50% of the government buildings, 2% of civilian infrastructure (excluding hospitals and schools), and scare the shit out of the general population, just to show them that you can. And for that you need foot soldiers.</p>
<p>That didn't translate well to a movie about killing as many bugs as possible.</p>

<p>It was a bit more subtle than that. It wasn't just a show of force, it was as a punishment and war tactic. There was a scene in the book where one of the cadets is asking why they don't just nuke the enemy and the instructor basically responds by saying you spank a small child when it misbehaves, you don't kill it.  </p>

        <p>A nuke would be a show of force, selective destruction is a show of confidence and control. I was thinking about the bit later on where Rico says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can be selective, applying precisely the required amount of pressure at the specified point at a designated time . . . .</p>

        <p>I was thinking of this scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well . . . you see, sir? If we can use an H-bomb - and, as you said, it's no checker game; it's real, it's war and nobody is fooling around - isn't it sort of ridiculous to go crawling around in the weeds, throwing knives and maybe getting yourself killed . . . and even losing the war . . . when you've got a real weapon you can use to win? What's the point in a whole lot of men risking their lives with obsolete weapons when one professor type can do so much more just by pushing a button?"</p>
<p>Zim didn't answer at once, which wasn't like him at all. Then he said softly, "Are you happy in the Infantry, Hendrick? You can resign, you know." Hendrick muttered something; Zim said, "Speak up!"</p>
<p>"I'm not itching to resign, sir. I'm going to sweat out my term."</p>
<p>"I see. Well, the question you asked is one that a sergeant isn't really qualified to answer . . . and one that you shouldn't ask me. You're supposed to know the answer before you join up. Or you should. Did your school have a course in History and Moral Philosophy?"</p>
<p>"What? Sure - yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Then you've heard the answer. But I'll give you my own - unofficial - views on it. If you wanted to teach a baby a lesson, would you cut its head off?"</p>
<p>"Why . . . no, sir!"</p>
<p>"Of course not. You'd paddle it. There can be circumstances when it's just as foolish to hit an enemy city with an H-bomb as it would be to spank a baby with an ax. War is not violence and killing, pure and simple; war is controlled violence, for a purpose. The purpose of war is to support your government's decisions by force. The purpose is never to kill the enemy just to be killing him . . . but to make him do what you want him to do. Not killing . . . but controlled and purposeful violence. But it's not your business or mine to decide the purpose or the control. It's never a soldier's business to decide when or where or how - or why - he fights; that belongs to the statesmen and the generals. The statesmen decide why and how much; the generals take it from there and tell us where and when and how. We supply the violence; other people - 'older and wiser heads,' as they say - supply the control. Which is as it should be. That's the best answer I can give you. If it doesn't satisfy you, I'll get you a chit to go talk to the regimental commander. If he can't convince you - then go home and be a civilian! Because in that case you will certainly never make a soldier."</p>
