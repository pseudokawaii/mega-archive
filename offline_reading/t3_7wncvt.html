    <p><p>Friday, 9 February 2018: <strong>No Memo for You</strong>  </p>
<p>Last week you've met Rachel Brand, now say goodbye to her as she is resigning from her post in the Justice Department | The turmoil inside the White House continues after Rob Porter's abusive behavior was found out, and WH officials knew about it for months | Chief of Staff John Kelly apparently offered his resignation to Trump, after the account of his response to abuse claims conflict with public record | Questions arise if WH Communications Director Hope Hicks and WH Counsel Don McGahn need to take the blame about Porter as well | Trump won't approve the release of the Democratic memo rebuttal to the already released Nunes memo, citing security issues | WH speechwriter resigns amid domestic abuse allegations (which he denies) |  Trump rarely, if ever, reads daily intel briefings, parting ways with yet another White House tradition  </p>
