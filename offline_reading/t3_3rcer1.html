    <strong>[REQUEST] Fargo S02E04 1080p WEB-DL</strong>
    <p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Ended up filling my own request; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/megalinks/comments/3rcer1/request_fargo_s02e04_1080p_webdl/cwnq08z">check here</a>.  Only thing is, it's not on Mega, but the site is free with comparable speeds and I can't find the WEB-DLs for this episode (or S02E03, which I also included) anywhere else, so I hope it helps!</p>
<hr>
<p>Haven't seen many WEB-DL shares of Season 2 of Fargo, and certainly none on free hosts like mega (or gamefront or zippyshare, apparently the last 3 free hosts that you can download from without payment in less than 72 hours time)</p>
<p>Anyone have any links to the 1080p WEB-DL of Fargo S02E04?</p>
<p>Love this show, own S1 on Blu-Ray, but no TV to watch the new season :(</p>
<p>Help?</p></p>

        <p>OP here: I found the 1080p WEB-DL for both S02E03 and S02E04 for those who are interested!</p>
<p>It took some hunting and sadly they are not on mega (yet) but they're on another free file host and I downloaded S02E03 (1.93GB) in 23 minutes and 19 seconds, which is fairly comparable with Mega given my connection speed.</p>
<p>I've been waiting for S02E04 to pop up somewhere and have been checking the usual haunts but no luck, apart from a WEBRip and the <strong>WEB-DL</strong> is definitely <em>far</em> superior.</p>
<p>I know the 1080p WEB-DL has been out for the first 2 episodes of the season but for some reason this is not the case for E03 and E04, outside of seemingly one sole poster.  I found the sole poster/sharer on a public forum (you have to register to see the links, but registration is free) who has shared them and I haven't seen the links anywhere else.  All credits go to that poster that shared them (see screenshots below).</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how to share these since I'm not sure how quickly they'd go down if I posted the links directly and since it's a "semi-private" forum even though anyone can register and see links right away, so I'm not sure what the etiquette on privacy there is.  I decided to post screenshots - sorry that it's a pain to type out the URLs manually, but they aren't that long.  At least this way with the screenshots you don't have to register.</p>
<p><em>Note 1: The poster shared them on go4up which has it shared on 3 hosts: uptobox, uploaded and 1fichier.  At least here in America (plus other parts of the world) Uptobox is blocked, but someone in an unblocked country might find it helpful?  As for uploaded, without paying for an account downloading from that site takes FOREVER (20kb/s for 5 files totalling roughly 4.5GB?  No thanks), especially with the 3 hour wait period in between downloads.  1fichier isn't mega, but using the free mode I still managed to get comparable speeds with it, though your mileage may vary.  Only restrictions appear to be a 5 minute wait between downloads and no simultaneous downloads.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: There's a password listed for both but I don't believe I needed it.  Still, I included it in the screenshots in case anyone needs it.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 3: Since I found the other 2 hosts on go4up to be useless and because go4up has annoying pop-ups that none of my add-ons seemed to stop, I also took a screenshot of just the direct ifichier links of each in a document so you can type those out instead.</em></p>

<p>May not be mega, but it's free, the speed seems about the same and I figured I'd pass this forward after finding it since as far as I can tell that seems to be the only place with WEB-DL links (1080p <em>or</em> 720p) for these 2 episodes.  Hope this helps!!</p>

<p>Here is the 720p x265 copy. If you're determined to have 1080p, check psarips later tonight and it should be up :)</p>

        <p>Thanks for the prompt mega link!</p>
<p>I've been checking psarips and others throughout the day but still no 1080p link or WEB-DL link; however, I did manage to find a single post with a 1080p WEB-DL link to both this and the last ep and while it's not on Mega, one of the 3 hosts used is fairly comparable in speed - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/megalinks/comments/3rcer1/request_fargo_s02e04_1080p_webdl/cwnq08z">link</a>.</p>
<p>Wonder why there's no WEB-DL or even 1080p links anywhere (that I've found) for S02E03 (aired 8 days ago) or S02E04 (aired 24 hours ago) outside of that one source?</p>

        <p>I keep looking myself, but haven't even seen any for episode 3 yet. I used to be able to check Divxcentral for them, but now it's on some sort of invite-only/premium thing. </p>
