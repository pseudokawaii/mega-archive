    <strong>[TV] MSNBC: Wednesday, 14 February 2018 (Parkland High School Shooting Coverage) [360p WEBRip | x264 | AAC] [3.44GB]</strong>
    <p><p>Wednesday, 14 February 2018: <strong>Parkland, Florida</strong>  </p>
<p>So much for Valentine's Day... A 19-year-old shot up his former high school and killed 17 people, making this America's high school shooting with the most victims, and the third-worst school shooting in America (after Virginia and Newtown) | As the tragic events unfolded, the White House cancelled the press briefing altogether, after having rescheduled it multiple times | As the coverage continued, some news about the White House broke as well, with more than 100 White House staffers, including Ivanka Trump and WH Counsel Don McGahn (not to mention Kushner), don't have security clearances | Also, thanks to Michael Cohen blasting it out into the world that he paid off Stormy Daniels from his own pocket, the Non-Disclosure Agreement is void and she can tell her story now | Meanwhile, the gun debate has flamed up again, waiting to be extinguished once more by the Republicans' shallow and meaningless words  </p>
