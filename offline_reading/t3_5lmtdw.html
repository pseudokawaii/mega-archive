<p>THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THEATRICAL AND WORKPRINT LEAK<br>
[SOURCE]
(https://sites.google.com/site/blackout0189/drive)  </p>
<p>I've had the chance to watch both versions of the films, and while the differences may be viewed as 'minor' the impact both leave are slightly at odds. The leaked version I saw was an early cut, months before its premiere at Cannes (some of the special FX were not finished)  </p>
<p>1- The dispatcher at the beginning of the film (during the opening getaway) is a male. While in the theatrical it is a female. The dialogue is different and there seems to be more chatter on the leaked version and has an overall different tone.  </p>
<p>2- "Tick of the Clock" is absent during most of the chase in the leaked version, while the theatrical had it pulsating throughout the scene.  </p>
<p>3- The goons in the back seat during the opening getaway talk much more often in the leaked version.<br>
"Dont freak out yet"<br>
"Come on man come on!"<br>
They talk to Driver and to each other while in the theatrical they barely say anything at all.  </p>
<p>4- Scoring is used much more often, almost non-stop during the first half of the film. Many of the 'awkward' prolonged silences that people have complained about have been accompanied with scoring in the leaked version. It actually makes the silences work a little easier, it gives the viewer something to latch on to and tells them how to feel about the silence between the two characters.  </p>
<p>5- When Bernie is in the car shop talking to Driver about how Shannon "Never had good luck" instead of yelling out for Nino in the theatrical version<br>
"Nino, lets get the <em>beep</em> outa here! Come on!"<br>
in the leaked version he says<br>
"Lets get the hell out of here. Nino!"<br>
A small, subtle change, but its interesting they added in an extra swear for good measure.  </p>
<p>6- The Social Network Soundtrack appears in the leaked version, The song "Hand covered Bruise" is used during the sequence were Driver talks with Irene in the diner and takes the single bullet from Benicio. The song "Intriguing Possibilities" appears as Driver prepares for the pawn shop robbery (speaking with Cook and Standard)
In the theatrical version this sequence is played with the song "Where is the Deluxe Version?" on the Drive Soundtrack.  </p>
<p>7- The dialogue between Driver and Irene in the diner is slightly different in the Leaked version but puts a different spin on the whole scene.<br>
Driver - "How is Benice?"<br>
Irene - "Good"<br>
Driver - "...You just saying that?"<br>
Irene - "...No...What do you mean?"<br>
This change in dialogue adds a serious dark tone to the whole conversation. Driver, instead of trying to comfort Irene and talk about Standard in the theatrical version, he prods her and sees if she is lying to him. This portrays Driver as a much darker, less human person by flat out say she is lying or hiding something from him. I prefer the theatrical version.  </p>
<p>7- News report about robbery only shows a single still image of the exterior of the pawn shop in the leaked version. The theatrical version had an on-air news reporter, as well as mug shots of Standard.  </p>
<p>8- Christina Hendricks death is not finished in the leaked version. The effect of her head is not completely rendered so all that is visible is Hendrick tilting her head and a harsh white light were the bloody effect will be placed. - Its interesting to see the unfinished shot compared to the shocking final version in the theatrical cut.  </p>
<p>9- The second hitman that attacks the motel room from the front door is only seen in two shots in the theatrical cut. In the leaked version he has more time on screen- an extra shot of him struggling to get by the mattress against the door. And another shot of his body on the ground after being shot by Driver (he is face-down on the other side of the box spring, only his legs are visible) His screen time actually built on the tension already present, constantly reminding the audience there is still another Hitman in the room with Driver.  </p>
<p>10- No scoring at all during the strip-joint scene were Driver threatens Cook and calls Nino in the leaked version. The silence is one of the few times that is actually filled in the theatrical version instead of the other way around. - Personally I liked it better with the intense score in the theatrical.  </p>
<p>11- Sound design for the infamous Elevator Sequence is completely different in the Leaked Version. The theatrical version had scoring as well as different sounds for the actual fight, including the bashed skull. In the leaked version there is more silence and the skull bashing does not sound as juicy. Sounds like a nit-pick but the sound design really made the scene for me looking back, and I definitely enjoyed the theatrical version better.  </p>
<p>12- The beach scene were Driver drowns Nino is over silence in the leaked version. In the theatrical version the scene had the erie score "The Beach" which had a foreboding nature to it and framed Driver as a unstoppable killing machine. I think it works much better with the soundtrack scoring.  </p>
<p>13- The phone call between Bernie and Driver where "The Scorpion and the Frog" is discussed is completely absent in the leaked version! There is totally different dialogue all together!<br>
in the leaked version this is what is said<br>
Bernie - "Nino? Nino?! Who is on the telephone?"<br>
Driver - "You know who this is..."<br>
Bernie - "...Where is Nino?"<br>
Driver - "He's gone."  </p>
<p>The rest of the conversation plays out almost verbatim what was in the theatrical version. But WOW does this conversation portray both characters in a completely different way. Driver is more of a human-being who is caught up in some bad stuff. While the Scorpion and the Frog reference in the theatrical version painted him as a more icon and legendary character, and also brought a new layer to the whole film and how the characters are connected to one another. I have seen several threads on IMDB talking about this single piece of dialogue. Without it the scene plays out very differently and casts both Bernie and Driver as more human that the arch type they represent.  </p>
<p>14- The showdown between Bernie and Driver has a few extra shots in the leaked version. It has a quick cut of a CU shot of Bernie pulling out his switch blade, then cuts back to Driver and Bernie talking one more time. Then cuts to Driver actually being stabbed. The introduction of the knife in the leaked version I think breaks the suspense and utter shock when Driver actually does get stabbed in the theatrical cut. The surprise of it is half of the enjoyment! Also the shadow shot of Driver and Bernie both falling to the pavement is played with actually sound design in the leaked cut, you can hear Bernie actually die.<br>
In the theatrical cut it is played silently over the score, adding to dramatic effect rather than going for a more realistic approach.</p>
<p>15- In the leaked version there is no shot of dead Bernie with the bag of money by his side, instead Driver just drives off. This implies that he may have kept the money in this version instead of leaving it behind (Symbolizing it was never about the money) that small cut says so much about Driver's character and now without it, one would assume that Driver is now a million dollars richer.</p></p>

        <p>Do you happen to have the theatrical version you could upload as well? I don't think I have ever seen this movie sober and it is always a surreal experience.</p>
<p>All the previous links from this subreddit all got taken down.
Any format would be appreciated, but my preference is 1080p x265.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

        <p>Its a rough cut of a movie. It means its not the finished, completed version of the movie. It has not gone through all of its editing. Sometimes these cuts will have extra footage different ormissing music, or the dubbed in sounds and special effects haven't been added. Sometimes it also has stock footage in place for shots that are missing that they need to reshoot or replace.</p>
