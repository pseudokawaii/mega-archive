    <strong>[TV] COPS - Season 27 (mixed quality) [7.8GB]</strong>
    <p><p>I came across some great uploads of this show <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/megalinks/comments/657efb/tvreupcops_seasons_125various_quality/">here</a> a little while back.  I forgot how much I liked it; and I also found out that it can be surprisingly difficult to find non-potato-vision, properly organized and labeled episodes/packs easily, and without resorting to public torrents.</p>
<p>So after a lot of searching and mucking about, I cobbled together Season 27 for my own enjoyment, and to give a little something back to the sub, and, to partially/temporarily fix the lack of COPS love on the internet.</p>
<p>Most of the episodes are 480p-ish.  Three are 720p.  The 480p-ish eps all have a decent, and an at least acceptable to me, bit-rate.  I'm linking a folder with screenshots for every episode.  On them, all the vital stats are there.</p>
<p>This is the complete Season 27, <em>except</em> for episode 9.  Episode 9 was a special 'tribute' episode.  One of the camera/sound men was killed while working on the show, and so a special double-length episode was put together to showcase his work.  I believe <em>most</em> of what is contained in this episode was stuff from old episodes.  I would have included it, but I couldn't find it in an acceptable quality.</p>
<p>Different episode guides for season 27, show different episode names/numbers. This is because of episode 9.  It threw off the number conventions.  This pack is based on <a href="http://imgur.com/a/PCG1x">THIS</a> guide.  The episode names themselves, i.e. the words that come after the season and episode numbers..."Tazer Proof", or whatever it may be, are correct.  But if you looked at a different guide, it might say that "Tazer Proof" was episode 11, instead of episode 12.  Hope that makes sense.  </p>

        <p>I kind of started the whole COPS posting, but you guys have all far surpassed my posting abilities. Hard as hell to find episodes especially when the only released dvd's are all "special collections" of random episodes, but you all continue to surprise. Thank you!</p>
