    <strong>[AUDIOBOOK] Halo: Primordium - Greg Bear (Stereo, 128 kb/s, 44.1 kHz) [685.3 MB]</strong>
    <p><blockquote>
<p>Halo: Primordium is the second novel in The Forerunner Saga by Greg Bear and is the sequel to Halo: Cryptum. It was released on January 3, 2012, with an audio edition released simultaneously. The sequel to the novel, Halo: Silentium, was released on March 19, 2013. Similar to Halo: Cryptum, the story is told as a first-person narrative, from the perspective of Chakas, one of the two humans who accompanied Bornstellar Makes Eternal Lasting during the events of Cryptum. The novel is set primarily on Installation 07, a Halo ring under control of the rampant Mendicant Bias. After crash-landing on the ring during Mendicant Bias' assault on the Capital, Chakas is joined by two local humans, Vinnevra and Gamelpar, in an odyssey to find his companion Riser. As they attempt to survive on the war-torn Halo, they face several obstacles, including the ancient being known as the Primordial, the Flood, and Mendicant Bias. Like the rest of The Forerunner Saga, the novel's story has resonant connections to Halo 4, among them the introduction of the Composer.</p>
