    <strong>[TV] Chaos Full Series - 2011 CBS - NOT ON DVD</strong>
    <p><p>Premise - 
Rogue CIA spies in the Office of Disruptive Services combat threats to national security. Armed with outdated technology and limited supplies, the team uses manipulation, deception and wits to tackle missions involving high-risk foreign intelligence. Freddy Rodriguez stars as Rick Martinez, who joins the CHAOS team after his dream job as a spy is eliminated because of budget cuts on his first day.</p>
<p>(Episode 9 was damaged in the digital recording, and I looked, but couldn't find the series anywhere so I took the DVD I recorded them on and ripped it, so Ep 9 has commercials and is not as good of quality) </p>
<p>They are MP4 so they can play on a XBOX360</p>

<p>I know no one asked for this, but I loved this series and think CBS made a mistake canning it the way they did, they played it out of order and only showed 3 of the 13 episodes......</p>
<p>I also wished that they at least released the series on DVD so I could have a proper version of it, instead of the bootleg I made. </p></p>
