    <strong>[REQUEST][TV] Episodes of Check It Out! With Dr. Steve Brule Season 3 in 480p WEB-DL Quality</strong>
    <p><p>Help would definitely be most appreciated. Somehow I managed to find the entire Season 4 thus far in 480p WEB-DL quality (As close to DVDRip as it gets) but have had no such luck with Season 3. Only TWO episodes I could find were WEB-DL and they were both 720p (and 5 times the size of a 480p file). The remainder of Season 3 only seems to currently exist in 720p/1080p HDTV rip quality (simultaneously, a complete waste of disk space AND we have the [adult swim] logo killing the atmosphere).</p>
<p>If you have WEB-DL quality files but only in 720p or higher I'm find with that also, 480p is just preferred. I'd also like a WEB-DL DVD-quality rip of Bagboy if it exists. Thanks!</p></p>
