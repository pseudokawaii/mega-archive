        <p>Many years ago, I saw a guy and his girlfriend sitting on a curb downtown and she was crying. I asked what was wrong and he explained that they were driving cross country, car broke down and they had been scammed of their money and had no place to stay, so I let them stay at my house until they could get their shit together.</p>
<p>We had a great time during their short stay, they were great company. The guy said his name was Murphy. He had so many amazing stories to tell over beers and smoke. He claimed that when he was in the army, he was in charge of certain psychological experiments. Told us of many amazing experimental drugs they tested on people, and other psychological test methods.</p>
<p>When I saw this movie years later, there were about 3 or 4 times where my wife and I looked at each other and said "Shit, that's about MURPHY!!" So many of the stories he told us all those years ago were mirrored in the movie, we're sure this stranger that stayed at our house for those few days was probably at least consulted on it.</p>
<p>I took his stories with a grain of salt. Two guys talking over beers can be a bit exaggerated. His stories were too silly to really take as unembellished truth, especially the ones about LSD-type of research chemicals and freeing the goats. But that movie really made me think. If you're out there Murphy, this bud's for you.</p>

        <p>For it to be a documentary the whole movie must have been based on true events, which it is not.
Its a movie based on a book, thus "Film Adaptation". The book describes true events but the movie would under comedy genre.</p>
