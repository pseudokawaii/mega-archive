    <strong>[Question] Is it safe to Download without a VPN?</strong>
    <p><p>Yeah it's the obligatory question again but I just stumbled across this subreddit as a german guy who has basically no chance to get Westworld legally except the shitty Sky Service. And as far as I understand it's the seeding through torrents that will mostly get you (as it got me last year) but what about just downloading encrypted files?</p></p>

        <p>Downloading through Mega, either via the browser or the apps is perfectly safe. It's end to end encrypted so that you need the decryption key or else it's just viewed as Garbage data. So yes, you're perfectly safe downloading from MEGA. (as long as the file isn't tainted or corrupted)</p>

        <p>Alright, here's my question though, when the file downloaded it's usually called "WestworldS0103 x256" whatsoever, so how far does the descryption go when the file in the end is still obviously copyrighted content once it's on my PC</p>

        <p>Thanks for the answer. How come you say 'generally'? And no I don't torrent at all anymore, that's over after I got caught for 800 bucks last year. I don't download at all anymore but Westworld is something I can't miss.</p>

        <p>DDL hoster like uploaded or Share-Online (Not sure about MEGA) save your IP for 2 - 6 hours (Longer if you're a premium user) So lets say an agency wants to go at you  for whatever reasons they can go to the hosters and ask for your IP. This usually never happens, since most agencys go after the uploader. But even that isn't that big of a deal because most hoster just log the traffic connected to your IP, not the file you downloaded. MEGA should be saver than both mentioned hoster.</p>

        <p>the main problem with torrenting is that in order to download something, you also have to upload to other peers. this is sharing copyrighted material. they don't care anywhere near as much about people downloading it as they do people spreading it. as for mega's safety; it's https. all your ISP can see is where you're downloading from and how much. they don't see what it is at all. you should also be using a DNS server other than your ISP's, this helps prevent them from seeing where and when you're going to certain websites.</p>

        <p>HTTPS, &amp; end-to-end encryption means you're probably the only one who can see those things. Even if it weren't ISPs rarely snoop on customers for copyright violations. While torrenting from a public tracker what happens is that the people working for the copyright holders gets the list of IP addresses that were downloading their media file, these IP addresses are plainly accessible to anyone. They forward these IP addresses to their respective ISPs (the ones that care enough to do anything about it), and the ISPs will then sent a DMCA notice to you, the IP holder, ~~which you can safely ignore~~. The only people that can rat you out is the people at Mega.nz. And I don't think they're going to do that.</p>

        <p>Ahh okay. So in order for them to see my IP Adress they would 1) know which decrypted file I was downloading and 2) look through all the IP Adresses that downloaded it and find mine which won't happen because MEGA won't allow that?</p>

        <p>Now that I think about it, because the key is visible to anyone who visits this sub there may be some complex ways to do those things. But they would be way too expensive, and impractical. And on the rare occasions that copyright holders do file charges, and the case ends up in court, they're not doing so to punish the individual, they're doing it to set an example, and when going after people who download torrents is much easier there's no way they would go through all that trouble. Especially since torrent has become synonymous with piracy.</p>

        <p>Does this make any difference if you're using your schools wifi? The TOS for my schools wifi says "no torrenting under any circumstance" and that they track all internet traffic.

I know in 'murica isp's bend over backwards whenever they get asked for information, in England however the isp's usually tell them to fuck off.
