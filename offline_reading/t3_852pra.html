<p>Frankly My Dear, I Don't Give A Damn...Again! </p>
<p>Scarlett, the eight-hour mini-series based on Alexandra Ripley s best-selling sequel to Gone With the Wind, takes up precisely where that story left off, and sees Scarlett O Hara off on a journey from Atlanta to Charleston and Savannah, to London, and to her ancestral home of Ballyhara in Ireland. </p>
<p>The motive force behind the story is once again the turbulent romance between Scarlett and Rhett Butler. Separated from Scarlett and seeking a divorce, Rhett is now pursued passionately by his wife, who seeks a reconciliation. Frustrated in her effort and unwilling to win Rhett by telling him she is pregnant with their child, Scarlett leaves for Ireland, where she is caught up in the political upheaval of the day, and to England, where she must stand trial for a murder she did not commit. </p>
<p>In a dramatic climax, Rhett rushes to Scarlett s side, knowing that she needs him and that her life is at stake. Helping to win her acquittal and finally apprised that they have a son, Rhett reunites with Scarlett, conceding that he never stopped loving her. </p></p>
