<p>The Gladiator: Directed by Abel Ferrara (Bad Lieutenant, King of New York), and starring Ken Wahl (Wise Guy), Nancy Allen (Robo Cop, The Philadelphia Experiment), and Robert Culp (The Greatest American Hero, I Spy). Master mechanic Rick (Wahl) loses his brother to a homicidal maniac who kills motorists at random in his "death car." After a run in with a gang of punks who destroy his truck, Rick decides to become a vigilante. He converts his pick up into an armed and dangerous vehicle. Hunting down reckless drivers, he leaves them handcuffed for the police to find. The cops are after this "Gladiator," but Rick won't let up until he finds his brother's assassin, "Skull." When the two meet, it's a duel to the death and maybe an end to Rick's career as the vigilante Gladiator.</p></p>
