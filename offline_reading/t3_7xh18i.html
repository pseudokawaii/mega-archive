<p>Still in his first flush of muscular stardom, Burt Lancaster romps through this costume adventure in full awareness of his movie-star dazzle. The story is a Robin Hood-tinged yarn set in 12-century Lombardy, where ace archer Lancaster finds himself an unlikely rebel leader against the evil lord (Frank Allenby)--actually, our hero just wants to get his kidnapped son back. Oh, and maybe win the hand of the fair Virginia Mayo. Nobody from director Jacques Tourneur on down seems to have taken the story very seriously, which leaves plenty of room for the odd strolling minstrel (Norman Lloyd in puckish form), good-bad romantic rival (Robert Douglas), or mute sidekick. The latter is played by Nick Cravat, the stumpy and swarthy acrobat who had performed alongside Lancaster in their circus careers (he would return in The Crimson Pirate, the best-known of Lancaster's swashbucklers). Here, the two men execute a series of glorious physical stunts, showing off their crack timing and willingness to risk life and limb. That's really the appeal of the picture, along with Ernest Haller's Oscar-nominated Technicolor photography and the lavish Italy-by-way-of-Burbank studio sets.</p></p>
