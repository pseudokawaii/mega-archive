<p>In 1903 the scientist Marie Curie (Karolina Gruszka) was the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize for Physics together with her husband Pierre (Charles Berling). But only a short time later, with just mid-thirties and as a young mother of two children, she loses Pierre by accident. In a world dominated by men, she makes her way steadfastly, continues her research alone, and is the first woman to receive a chair at the Sorbonne in Paris. When she falls in love with the married scientist Paul Langevin (Arieh Worthalter) after years of mourning and engages in an affair with him, she is however a violent scandal. Just as soon as it becomes known that she is receiving her second Nobel Prize - now for chemistry - the Paris press publishes correspondence between Marie and Paul, who passed on his vindictive wife. In the full glow of her professional fame, the brilliant scientist Marie Curie is thus the target of bad defamation. To the banal adulteress, she must bitterly learn that reason and passion are not compatible.</p>
