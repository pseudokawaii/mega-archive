        <p>Some clarification for anyone who might not be familiar with the series:</p>
<p>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo 2011 is the American film of the first novel in the Millennium Series starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara</p>
<p>The Girl who Played with Fire 2009 is the Swedish adaptation of the second book in the Millennium series (there are Dragon Tattoo and Hornet's Nest films in Swedish as well. The series was adapted into three films in Swedish, which is the original language and nationality of the author, Steig Larsson.)</p>
<p>There are four books in the Millenium series, which are in the 4 book pack here, but theres an important distinction.</p>
<p>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</p>
<p>The Girl who Played with Fire</p>
<p>The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest </p>
<p>Those are the first three books in the series. Those are the ones written by Steig Larsson. All were published after Steig died of a heart attack in 2004. They became insanely popular and the publisher wanted to continue the series.</p>
<p>The Girl in the Spider's Web is the fourth book in the series (same characters, same tone, same feel, same everything) except it was written by     David Lagercrantz.</p>

        <p>Also worth noting, there's been a feud between Stieg's Wife and his father &amp; brother over the rights to his work, so more than likely, we will never see what Stieg planned for the end of the series until this feud is settled.</p>

        <p>It really is sad. Poor guy wanted to leave it all to the Communists, but because the will wasn't witnessed, this whole mess happens.</p>
<p>I understand his wife's perspective on it. The only reason they were never married was to protect Steig's safety so they wouldn't have to make his address public, but even so, that has lead to such a complicated situation that, like you said, we will most likely not know for a long time what he originally had planned for the series.</p>
