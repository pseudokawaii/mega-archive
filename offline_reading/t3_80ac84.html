    <strong>[DOCUMENTARY] 100 Years of UFA [720p WEBRip | x264 | AAC] [815MB]</strong>
    <p><p>(2018 Deutsche Welle DocFilms)  </p>
<p><strong>UFA is Germany’s dream factory and it made movie history. Classics such as Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis” were made here and big Hollywood names like Alfred Hitchcock and Billy Wilder used UFA’s studios. An insight into the famous film production company.</strong>  </p>
<p>UFA - ‘un film allemand’ as the French say - is a German company that has made cinematic history. What defines UFA, this huge operation that has experienced so many ups and downs over its hundred-year history? From the German Empire of to the Weimar Republic, the Nazi period and the Adenauer era all the way to becoming a modern media company as part of the Bertelsmann consortium. In the early days, General Ludendorff used the UFA and the new medium of film as a propaganda weapon for the German Kaiser. During the Weimar Republic, UFA produced works such as "Dr. Mabuse,” "Metropolis” and "The Blue Angel.” It became particularly big when talkies came along, before Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels called for total submission. These days, however, UFA is making a name for itself with its polished historical miniseries. The company has also regularly overextended itself financially and has been bailed out by the German state several times. This documentary takes a look at a century of German film history with excerpts from famous films such as Metropolis by Fritz Lang and The Blue Angel, which gave Marlene Dietrich her breakthrough. And it also digs up some forgotten treasures.  </p>
