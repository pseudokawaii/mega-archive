<p>This movie is the real life story of Gladys Aylward, a Christian woman who was devoted to God and wanted to serve Him.
She was a poor servant girl in England, not educated, but the love of God lived in her heart and she wanted to share this
love with the people in China who did not know the love of God.
She saved her money and took a dangerous jurney to China, joined with a missionary woman in Northern China and
served as a missionary, helping the chineese people, and telling them about Jesus and the love of God.
She saved abandoned children`s lives, she ended up with 100 orphened children.
When the war started in the North, she rescued the 100 orphans by leading them through mountains and rivers to safety
to a Christian Mission in a far province. stars Ingrid Bergman</p></p>
