<p>Goldie Hawn, freshly launched into stardom via TV's Laugh-In gives a bubbly but nuanced performance in one of her first feature-film roles, $ (also known as Dollars). She and costar Warren Beatty look so darn cute together (as they would again later in Shampoo), and have such terrific onscreen chemistry, that we forgive the writers for needlessly making Hawn's character a hooker. Still, to borrow from Working Girl, Hawn's Dawn Divine has a bod for sin--but also, it turns out, a mind for business, at least the kind of business that Beatty's tousled, charming criminal, Joe Collins, has in mind. The film is set on location in Frankfort and Bavaria, Germany, and Scandinavia, and the glorious feel of Europe in the early '70s is here in all its splendor--and grit. Collins' crime is a devilish international bank heist, complicated by language, communists, the Cold War, and next to no technology. It's a sort of a no-frills Oceans Eleven, without the 11 sidekicks.</p></p>
