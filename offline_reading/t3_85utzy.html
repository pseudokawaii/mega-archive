    <p><p>no.102: <strong>Analyzing Analytica</strong>  </p>
<p>Six more years of Vladimir Putin in power | A serial bomber is on the run in Austin, sending exploding packages to unsuspecting victims | The story of Trump-backed, Mercer-financed, Bannon-led Cambridge Analytica, and how they used Facebook "don't care" attitude to harvest data of millions of US Facebook users to use them and build voter profiles during the 2016 election | After this news broke, Facebook lost a couple of billions of net worth, plunging the DOW on Wall Street | Trump set to call for death penalty for drug dealers | Trump rages against Robert Mueller in the first targeted and named attack against the special counsel | McCabe gives Mueller memos detailing Trump meetings | Trump hires new lawyer in Stormy Daniels case, after previously telling the world the NYT falsely reported that he was bringing in a new lawyer, because he was happy with his legal team | Probably not by coincidence, that new lawyer has a connection to one of Mueller's corroborating witnesses (you know, the one who likes naked boys)  </p>
