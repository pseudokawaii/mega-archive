<p>DVD 1 : A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, EXTENDED CUT<br>
Full DVD /4.3Gb / .iso image / NTSC / 16:9 / Widescreen 1.85:1 A.R.<br>
Dolby Digital AC3 2.0 stereo 448kbps [English]<br>
Runtime: 01:40:21  </p>
<p>This 2009 extended edit of the best horror film of the 80s marks its 25th anniversary, and features 9 minutes of restored and digitally enhanced footage, new or longer scenes, alternate takes, a reworked soundtrack and for the very first time, Johnny Depp's full and uncut death scene fully re-edited into the film, the SPFX of Heather Langenkamp's blue screen footage finalized, as well as Craven's original ending the way he wanted it to be seen. Every added shot has been colour-corrected and cleaned, and the film's soundtrack has been completely remastered and reworked. This is a brand new edit done in 2009, not the low-quality 2004 edit previously available. I started from scratch in order to deliver a high quality, coherent and longer edit of the film, finally including some never-before-used footage, making this the ultimate Nightmare edit, completed by a second DVD of bonus materials [cf. details below]. The DVDs include animated menus and chapters. The differences between the regular cut and this extended cut are as follow :  </p>
