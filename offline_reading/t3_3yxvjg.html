        <p>My buddy Faysal was one of the main pirates in that film.  The spoken Somali in that film sounds like they are robots talking or they are not talking naturally.  When I watch English movies, the actors actually talk as if in real life and not like robots, but the Captain Phillips movie disapointed me because all the Somali's except Barkhad were repeating words in Somali and they sounded odd.  Anyways spoiler alert**</p>
<p>When they captured Muse (Barkhad), they just let him stand as they guarded him and in the end they received radio orders to take him down, and this was odd to me because he is already captured in another vessel so he can't even influence other pirates since he is gone.  </p>
