    <p><p>Tuesday, 6 February 2018: <strong>The Ignored Shutdown Advocate</strong>  </p>
<p>No market crash, after the DOW surges sharply after massive losses | Trump would love to see a government shutdown ("and it's worth it" for the country), because Democrats don't do anything about border security, according to him | WH Chief of Staff said that immigrants who didn't sign up for DACA are "too afraid" and "lazy", creating an oxymoron in the process | Trump's lawyers are worried he will be charged with lying to investigators | Steve Bannon's talk with Mueller's team delayed to next week, and top Democrats don't like that | Missouri Democrat wins in heavily Republican State House district | Elon Musk and SpaceX sent a car to space  </p>
