    <p><p>no.92: <strong>The Sex, the Liar &amp; the Law</strong>  </p>
<p>Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen was not a smart man, when he used the company email to arrange hush money deal with Clifford | Did Trump use the surprise of Kim's invitation acceptance to deflect from the Stormy scandal he currently finds himself in? | Trump in conflict with Tillerson over NK leader face-to-face, and even Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders figured she could say that the President is not going to meet with Kim until certain requirements have been met | Trump's legal team wants to make a deal with Mueller: an interview in exchange for the end of the Russia probe 60 days after the interview | Sam Nunberg showed up before the grand jury, and apparently didn't answer questions very much | FL Governor Rick Scott caves in, goes against the NRA and signs new gun reforms into law, which, among other things, guarantees certain employees in schools to be armed | Naturally, because the NRA can't help themselves, they sue the state now | White House refuses Oversight Committee request for information on Rob Porter  </p>
