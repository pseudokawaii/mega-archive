        <p>Well I just DLed and watched Jackrabbit and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think the Actor Caras face was very expressive, and the lighting and settings were very sensitive and painterly.
The composition was stunning scene after scene.
As far as the plot, I was confused but in a way that made me focus and concentrate and of course that's very compelling too.
I've read elsewhere that not much was happening and it was sluggish but that viewer must not have been paying attention, I found there was a lot happening and observing and figuring out what was going on .... Well that was very cool for me.
 Anyway ima watch it again tomorrow night, and maybe look for Caras in something else.</p>
