    <strong>[Meta] Add Posters to Video Files</strong>
    <p><p>So yes, it is possible to add posters to video files. It can be done in itunes, but the big issue, you need to download each and every poster. Not really an issue, unless you have a few hundred movies like me. There are a few ways out there, but itunes seems the most reliable. I found a program called Metax for Windows, and there is also a port for Mac too. You can add whatever video files you want, such as .mkv, .mp4, .m4v, and others (It does have issues with a few video types, I personally couldn't get .avi to work consistently.) I found a copy on Teh Parad ox (the spacing is intentional).</p></p>

        <p>Most popular media center servers manage this... iTunes is actually behind the times. Albeit, I think intentionally. They provide artwork for digital media you purchase through them. I highly doubt they would automate providing intellectual property (movie posters count, I believe) for media that is possibly pirated...</p>

        <p>You can add posters, or "Artwork" to "Home Videos", it's a handy feature, one that I didn't really use because of the slowness of the process, which is why I really appreciate this program.</p>

        <p>While I understand this what you're saying. You're asking this in the wrong place. First and foremost, most of the content on this site comes from other sources. I don't mean it as in the file download location is not owned by the uploader. I mean it in the sense that in most cases, the encoder is not on this forum. If you look at most of the video file names, you will see the name of the encoder. (KILLERS, DIMENSION, D3FiL3R, just to name a few)</p>
<p>The encoder is the person who would be remuxing these files to include the artwork. Most of the uploaders here simply source the file, create a mirror and re-share.</p>
<p>You're trying to offload the work of organizing your movie posters onto the uploaders. In theory, I agree. I've remuxed a great deal (150+ files) of my own collection. However, my original comment still stands, you're asking the wrong people.</p>
<p>For the record... iTunes is a terrible program for this purpose. You enjoy it because it's user friendly not because it's a powerful program. iTunes is a clunky program who's purpose is not Meta editing; the purpose is media playing. What you're suggesting is more like using Photoshop to write an essay because you can format text.</p>

        <p>Sorry if I came across wrong, I'm not asking anything, I simply wanted to share a tool I found for organizing my library that I thought others might appreciate. Most of the stuff uploaded doesn't have artwork, and I thought that people might want to add it. I spent time looking for a program to do this, and since I don't really have a need to re encode movies, and literally all I wanted to do was add posters in a time efficient way, this was perfect. Also, I know that iTunes is terrible, I can't stand to use it for ANYTHING, which is why I am suggesting using Metax instead of iTunes for metadata editing. I admit the title was not written well in retrospect, I am simply recommending Metax for the sole purpose of editing artwork on video files. </p>

        <p>I have heard of xbmc, (now Kodi) and have been using it for a few years now, but for adding images to files, itunes was the most reliable, and while you might not find it worthwhile, there are movies on this sub that do have images added to the video file, which is why I brought it up.</p>

        <p>Yes, it is true that media servers and centers can handle this quite well, but if you have stuff that your using on the go, like a flash drive, it's handy to have. This edits the metadata to add the poster to the video file, meaning that if you want to look at it in File Explorer, perhaps at a friends house, you still have the look. I agree that itunes it terrible, what is why I never worried about images on files before. At the same time, it does get annoying to see the thumnail of a minute or two into a movie when adding new content, and I personally like the VLC player more than Kodi, so the customization is worth it to me. http://danhinsley.com/metax/metax.html </p>

        <p>It's 10 bucks now, apparently the first version here: https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/24994/metax was discontinued, but they made Metaz for Mac, and created Metax, a port for Windows. For me, using Windows, there were not many options, so this is great.</p>

        <p>I think pahe.in does that for its movies and TV shows that are posted in this sub .</p>
<p>He and other uploader might not need a specific application just for adding your album art in video files . They probably mux their audio tracks and album art to the video file using MkvToolnix (that's why lot of .mkv files cause it's super easy to add multiple audio , video tracks , subtitles , tags and metadata to your video files ).</p>
