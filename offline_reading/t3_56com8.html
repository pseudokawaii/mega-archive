<p>Ask anyone in the UK what the two best comedies in the world are and you're get the same two answers (although sometimes in a different order): Fawlty Towers and Only Fools And Horses. OFAH is a British institution and it is a little known fact that it's illegal to have a Christmas without watching at least three episodes with your family.</p>
<p>Derek "Del Boy" Trotter (played by David Jason) is a fast-talking, archetypal South London wheeler-dealer who lives in a council flat in a high-rise tower block with his much younger brother, Rodney Trotter (Nicholas Lyndhurst), and their elderly Grandad (Lennard Pearce). Their mother Joan died when Rodney was young, and their father Reg absconded soon afterwards, so Del became Rodney's surrogate father and the family patriarch. </p>
<p>The situation focuses primarily on their futile attempts to become millionaires through questionable get rich quick schemes and by buying and selling a variety of poor-quality and illegal goods, such as Russian Army camcorders, luminous yellow paint and sex dolls filled with an explosive gas. They have a grubby three-wheeled Reliant Regal van and trade under the name of Trotters Independent Traders, mainly on the black market, and generally neither pay taxes nor claim money from the state; as Del says, "The government don't give us nothing, so we don't give the government nothing".</p>
<p>Initially, Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad were the show's only regulars, along with the occasional appearances of dopey roadsweeper Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) and pretentious used car salesman Boycie (John Challis). Over time, the cast expanded, mostly in the form of regulars at the local pub The Nag's Head. These included pub landlord Mike (Kenneth MacDonald), lorry driver Denzil (Paul Barber), youthful spiv Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray) and Boycie's flirtatious wife Marlene (Sue Holderness). Although the show still centred on the Trotter family, these characters became popular in their own right, contributing to the plots and humour.</p>
<p>As the series progressed, the scope of the plots expanded, and comedy was often mixed with drama. Many early episodes were largely self-contained, with few plot-lines mentioned again, but the show developed a story arc and an ongoing episodic dimension. The character of Grandad died following the death of Lennard Pearce, and his long-lost younger brother Uncle Albert (Buster Merryfield) emerged to restore the three-generation line-up. ("During the war...")</p>
<p>Yes, these are DVD rips. Yes, some episodes have changes made to them when compared to the original broadcasts. If you want to read about all the changes you can start at http://www.ofah.net/blog/only-fools-and-horses-cuts-part-1/ but really, most of the cuts are minor (mostly music, due to licensing problems) but it really doesn't affect the quality of the shows. Also included are a few bonuses in the form of The Story of OFAH and a couple of interviews with David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
