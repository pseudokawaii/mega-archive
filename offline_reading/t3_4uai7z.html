        <p>Yep, that's the primary way I download media to my phone. Thanks! Let me know if you can find the Simpsons season 13 to 27. Either way, thanks, that Always Sunny will be nice to have, too.</p>

        <p>To reiterate, my REQUEST was PRIMARILY for THE SIMPSONS, specifically seasons 13+, and also specifically formatted to function well on mobile, I.e. a 480p resolution mp4. My search for those seasons of The Simpsons turned up not only very few results for any seasons past 10, but they were all in a format and quality my phone had too much trouble playing. </p>
<p>I was never looking for It's Always Sunny, I simply said it was nice to have included in the results you gave me, which DIDN'T include ANYTHING I asked for. </p>
<p>To recap, I DID SEARCH. I found the same things you did, BUT THEY DO NOT WORK FOR MY PHONE. Hence the specific request for quality and format. None of the Futurama you put here works on my phone due to quality and format. None of The Simpsons you gave me were even of the same seasons I was looking for, AND it was in an incorrect format for my phone. Haven't even looked at the Sunny yet but I'd wager that it, too, is improperly formatted for my phone.</p>
<p>Thanks for the effort, but you didn't help me.</p>
