<p>Sabata-Who he is and where he came from, no one knows. But the leading citizens of the Western town of Daugherty think he knows too much. And they want to silence him forever. Get ready for the fast-paced, explosive action as Lee Van Cleef (For A Few Dollars More) stars as Sabata, the mysterious, steely-eyed gunslinger who, after he discovers Daugherty s elite are the masterminds behind the elaborate bank heist, imposes his bullet-laced brand of justice on the town. Bribes, bullets and even his turncoat best friend can t stop Sabata as he guns and gallops to a final spectacular shootout that s one of the biggest gunfights ever seen in the movies. Filmed in Spain and Italy, Sabata is another of producer Alberto Grimaldi s (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly) hard-hitting western, a series that began as an imitation of the Hollywood genre but resulted in the creation of a new screen star the Western anti-hero .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return of Sabata- Return of Sabata, producer Alberto Grimaldi and director Frank Kramer's (real name Gianfranco Parolini) third and final film about the adventures of the enigmatic, steely-eyed gunman of that name, is both the strangest of the three and arguably the one that most embodies the spaghetti Western aesthetic. Lee Van Cleef is back in the title role (Yul Brynner had stepped in for Adios, Sabata, the middle installment). So is essentially the same story formula (Sabata and his sidekicks take on the greedy villain who's extorting tax money from the good citizens of Hobsonville, with double-crosses the most common currency)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Adios Sabata- Yul Brynner replaces Lee Van Cleef in the title role for 1971's Adios, Sabata, the second and best entry in producer Alberto Grimaldi's spaghetti Western trilogy about the mysterious stranger with an unknown past and a penchant for righteousness, as long as there's serious cash involved. While some fans will miss Van Cleef's iconic performance, Brynner is just as good, even without the tongue-in-cheek attitude affected by the once and future Sabata (Van Cleef took over the part again for Return of Sabata, also released in '71). In fact, with his all-black outfit (replete with open-necked, fringe-bedecked shirt and a ten-foot scarf draped over one shoulder) and gold-plated rifle (equipped with a machine gun-like clip that only enhances his jaw-dropping marksmanship), this is a very cool Yul indeed, notwithstanding a somewhat androgynous vibe (not that there's anything strange about a gunslinger who plays Schubert on the piano, butÂ…). What's more, the film is several notches above both its predecessor (1969's Sabata) and its successor in almost every way; it's wittier, the editing and continuity are superior, the direction's more assured (Gianfranco Parolini, aka Frank Kramer, helmed all three installments), the stunts are more convincing, and the action comes fast and furious (though the fighting scenes aren't especially graphic, the body count is very high).</h1></p>
