        <p>So grateful for these, especially the audio/EDM lessons; I'm older than 40 and have been homeless for about a decade now. I could never afford school, and certainly don't have the image for the music industry. But, learning how my favorite music got made will change everything: I want you to know how meaningful it is to me.</p>

        <p>This is insane! Thanks so much for doing this, I'm definitely going to be grabbing some of these. </p>
<p>I'm figuring since a lot of the posts on the sub have to do with films, maybe there's a lot of lurkers like me who are into the prospect of film production.</p>
<p>Since you're asking for suggestions I'm just gonna kinda go all in. I'd along with a bunch of people I bet would greatly appreciate any amount of these lessons, feel free to grab as many or as little as you want, and thanks a ton for doing this mate.</p>
<p>After writing all this: Oh my god I feel like such a doofus and maybe even a little rude for asking for this much hahaha. Again don't worry about it if you don't want to do a lot of these. Also I don't know if this is against the rules but I'd love to donate some money if you do some of these. I'm kind of broke so it wouldn't be much but still. Thanks!</p>

        <p>The only thing I see on this subreddit or in your upload is two Microsoft Azure videos and six Amazon Web Services videos. Oh, and the first video of the Security+ series.</p>
<p>These are certificate preparation courses, you need the entire set for each one. Incomplete lessons, like you have for Azure and AWS, won't contain the knowledge required to pass these exams.</p>
<p>I understand it's a hassle, but I just figured I would clarify.</p>
