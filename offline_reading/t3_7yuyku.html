<p>This little comedy is based upon an actual incident of World War II. In an effort to get more speed out of some of its ships, the Navy tries an experiment using a modernized steam engine. Steam does prove to be capable of giving higher speeds but the problem is with getting enough fresh water to make the steam. A new design is tried to try and solve this problem but there is a war on and not many experience officers are available to conduct the trials.</p>
<p>Enter Gary Cooper. He plays an engineer who has been commissioned as a reserve officer. He has not real experience in ship handling but is assigned to command the experimental ship. He is not too worried at first. He figures he can rely on experience officers and crew and devote himself to the engineering problem. Unfortunately for him, the only experienced sailor is the bosun. All of the rest, officers and crew, are short time reservists. This leads to a slew of comedic situations.</p></p>
