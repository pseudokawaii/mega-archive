    <strong>[QUESTION] How safe is uploading and sharing files?</strong>
    <p><p>This subreddit has been around for awhile and I have yet to see this question asked or answered. Im curious to know as to how safe it is to upload movies (or other pieces of media) and what precautions should be taken when sharing. Also what are the potential risks? I have a ton of films that I'd love to share with the community, but first I'd like to see these questions answered. Thanks you for your time :)</p></p>

        <p>There are likely no real risks if you're just uploading. Sharing the links is where the risks come in, as you're distributing the files at that point. You should probably post links on a throwaway that you only log into via VPN, and change the mega.nz links to "xxxx.nz/#!DDdoisqjojdO281DOD!dsimosq" or something. Removing the "mega" part of the URL will keep bots and crawlers from picking it up. Lots of people also just post the second part of the URL, the "#!&lt;...&gt;" part.</p>
<p>Movie companies generally only pursue bittorrent users though. It's extremely unlikely that they'd ever pursue legal action against anyone for uploading to Mega.</p>

        <p>Yeah with mega it would take them a lot of work to find one person who uploaded something where with bittorrent they just have to connect to a swarm to get hundreds of people who are uploading all at once</p>

<p>bees fly where the honey is. Torrent swarms are like a honey factory, why bother with anything else?</p>
<p>These companies are under pressure as well, i dont know exactly how the business works, but im certain results are measured in numbers and there's NO WAY they can get the numbers up with mega &amp; co as quickly as they can with busting torrent swarms.</p>
<p>you could probaby think this even further. Im guessing the media companies dont really care about shutting the whole piracy down either. sure they would love it, but its unrealistic. At this point they probably see it as a 2nd income source~</p>

<p>I don't know...I have a suspicion they're actually trying to recoup losses spent on the lawyer/tech firms they're paying for.  Sure, net profit would be nice, but I don't think they're doing that.</p>
<p>It's not about income, but about prevention, making it not worth our while(to torrent, which is so easy even plebs started doing it).</p>
<p>I do know there was a small bubble of firms that would promise to pursue copyright infringement, but were utterly terrible at it.  I imagine some of them are weeded out now.... as someone above stated, it's a numbers game, those firms that had the highest numbers get the customers.</p>

        <p>Just to be safe, make another mega account for sharing files. keep your main account safe by not sharing a single file from it.</p>
