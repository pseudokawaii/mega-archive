    <strong>[MUSIC] Miles Davis - A Tribute to Jack Johnson (1971, VinylRip 24-96) (Jazz, Rock, Fusion) [FLAC, 1.1GB]</strong>
    <p><p>Vinyl rip of Davis' <em>A Tribute to Jack Johnson</em>, recorded initially as soundtrack work for a documentary about the life of boxer Jack Johnson.  Of all the recordings during Miles' electric period this one has the most defined "rock music" feel to it, especially at the start of the album.  This one is a great intro to Miles' electric/fusion period if you're interested but have never heard any of it before.</p>
<p>Each side of this album contains only one track, however the long songs both have defined sections and the music flows like a suite.  During this period Miles and producer Teo Macero would splice together several different tracks that were recorded during the sessions to create wholly new compositions, which was way out of the norm for jazz of the period (and probably still).  John McLaughlin's guitar work on <em>Jack Johnson</em> is phenomenal, a real highlight of the album.</p>
<p>Tracklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Side A - Right Off</li>
<li>Side B - Yesternow</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be uploading <em>The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions</em> in the near future, I'll update this post once that is done!</p>

<p>Enjoy folks, and as always PLAY IT LOUD!</p></p>
