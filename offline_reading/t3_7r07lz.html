<p>Macaulay Culkin (Richie Rich) is a clever kid out to reform his wayward father (Ted Danson, Three Men and a Baby, "Cheers") in this exuberantly zany, heartwarming comedy for the whole family. When he is dropped off at the home of Ray Gleason (Danson), the father he hasn't seen in years, Timmy (Culkin) hopes that they'll be able to spend some time together. Unfortunately, that's not what Dad has in mind. Involved in the get-rich-quick scheme of a lifetime, Ray and two klutzy cohorts are illegally paving the road to financial bliss...that is, until Timmy steps into their path. Recognizing that only he can set his father straight, this inventive kid creatively thwarts their plan and makes Ray do time...as a dad.</p></p>
