    <strong>[META] Suggestions re: requests</strong>
    <p><p>I've personally been coming to this subreddit less frequently recently in part because it has devolved into more [Request] posts than content submissions.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not a mod.. just someone who likes this community.. but I have a few suggestions to better this subreddit. First of all, there's nothing inherently wrong with request threads. It's awesome to see someone's shot in the dark for an old obscure show result in another user replying with a link of said show.</p>
<p>However, some requests are of recent shows that come up like clockwork every week on the same sites. To me those requests say "[Request] Someone to wait 30 seconds for link shorteners instead of me." Yeah it sucks to wait, but big deal, it's free otherwise super easy. Many, if not most, of the posts here come from those sites--when they aren't users' own uploads.</p>
<p>Now, such sites are: </p>
<p>yourserie.com</p>
<p>tuserie.com</p>
<p>tumovie.net</p>
<p>psarips.com </p>
<p>and 2ddl.tv (I think you usually have to go through go4up.com to access their mega uploads. </p>
<p>If you're having problems finding a working link on mega, I recommend hugefiles, 180upload, and mightyupload if possible. They have quick speeds without download restrictions. And they present fine with an adblocking extension.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are more of these sites as well.</p>
<p>Conversely, I know as a subscriber, I would appreciate if you are already going to these sites to download your favorite shows.. just stop by /new here and quickly post it if it hasn't already been posted. I will try to be more active in this sense myself. As I have been forgetting to lately. I don't think anyone is going to mind <strong>too</strong> many submissions of actual content. Although it's probably better to keep a batch of episodes from a single show in the same thread, if possible.</p>
<p>I hope I'm not out of line here. Just see ways everyone can find what they are looking for better.</p></p>

        <p>Not enough people actually search before posting a request thread and thats becoming a problem. I will try and spot new and relevant content on those sites and list them, or maybe we should create a weekly update of new content from those websites? </p>

        <p>people also need to stop requesting things that we all know are going to be uploaded. everyone here knows that game ofthrones will be uploaded the night it comes out. there should also be no requests before anything comes out. im tired of seeing requests for shows that dont air for like 3 hours or whole days. </p>

        <p>and if someone wants the show right away, then they can F5 yourserie until it's up, then be a helpful person and link the direct mega url here.</p>
<p>That person would probably get it faster than waiting for someone to respond to a request.</p>

<p>They should all be moved to /r/megarequests</p>
<p>Although I have never gotten an answer to any of my request :(</p>

<p>and 2ddl.tv </p>

<p>I could never figure out how to browse that page</p>

        <p>I fear that if every request goes to megarequests then very few will be answered. There is a place for requests here, it just seems like there should be fewer.</p>
<p>It seemed like a couple months back a lot more requests were being answered because they were more sparse, and users had a better balance of receiving and providing content.</p>
