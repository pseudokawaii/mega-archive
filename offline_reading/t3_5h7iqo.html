    <strong>[META] Many posters, including moderators, are no longer abiding by rule #1. I think everyone should follow the rules, or the rules need to changed. We should have a discussion about this.</strong>
    <p><p>Since the "Great MEGA crisis of 2016" (which was like a couple of days ago), people have started posting links to, well, pretty much whatever. Google drive, embedding links in images using steganography which <em>require</em> using 3rd party software to access, and posting links to 3rd party sites which require members to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/UEWCL">click through ads</a> in order to access the link. I was told by one of the moderators that spam filters had been set up to prevent non-MEGA links, but that doesn't seem to be working.</p>
<p>I know, I know. The responses are going to be "But BloodHawkDarkWolf, we <em>have to</em> do this to keep the content from being taken down." You <em>can</em> do this, but you don't <em>have to</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The reason files and accounts were deleted was because they had copyrighted content, and that content was widely shared. MEGA used everything at their disposal: hashes, email addresses, IP addresses. There were sites that are the source for much of the content here that <em>were</em> using 3rd party link protectors that had their accounts deleted also. So, to be clear, lack of 3rd party websites is not the reason that accounts were deleted. To put it in the simplest terms possible: these things were deleted because they broke MEGAs terms of service, and since the files are stored on their computers and they know who accesses them and how often they're going to catch on eventually. The deletions didn't happen because of this subreddit, or what does or does not happen here. /r/megalinks is a tiny cog in a big machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other posts have been  made since "The Great Bannening" without doing this that are working just fine. So this practice is optional, not necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So the next question is "So what's your problem with doing this anyway, dude?" Well there's a few.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's against the rules of the subreddit. A lot of people don't know this but when this subreddit started to pick up some months ago there was a push to use 3rd party "link protector sites" due to the fact that people could "make money" this way. People were pushing for monetized links on 3rd party link protector sites, basically advertising these sites and suggesting people to sign up and add their debit cards so they could make money. At this time the subreddit rules didn't exist. There was some discussion, the rules were created, and the reason people were required to make direct mega links was to keep things simple and, more importantly, to make sure <em>they were safe</em>. That's when the decision was made to prohibit url shorteners and 3rd party sites <em>due to the potential security risks</em>, and to keep the sub organized instead of devolving into people promoting every file-sharing website on the internet. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other problem is that the most reliable way to get a virus on the internet is clicking on ads on obscure websites. Like what's going on now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"If you're going to point out a problem shouldn't you suggest a solution too?" Here's my thoughts on it. I don't necessarily have a problem with using 3rd party websites to obscure links provided the following conditions are met.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's allowed by the rules. If the rules are going to be changed I think there should be a discussion by the community <em>and</em> the moderators, and there should be a consensus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The websites in question have been vetted by the community and the moderators to ensure they are not a security risk, i.e. risks of getting viruses/malware. I had brought this up before, but <em>if</em> we are to use 3rd party sites there should be a permitted list or whitelist of sites that are safe, and that information should be available in the rules on the sidebar. If we don't do this then inevitably people are going to post links to dodgy 3rd party sites just because they're trying to make money, and that's kind of shady.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd also like to point out again that there is <em>a lot</em> people can do to protect links against bots just by formatting their post differently, like breaking up urls and keys and posting them on different lines, or in the middle of a paragraph. You can also replace characters with random letters, or not provide the information at all and give people a hint like "The password is an animal that meows, all lowercase." People have skipped right past simple, effective steps that have zero risk in their rush to embrace nuclear options, and that's kind of hasty.</p>
<p>Lastly, I feel I'm obligated to mention that in the past posts discussing this particular topic have had a tendency to disappear. They will get deleted without warning or notice. Since this topic is relatively important, and deserves some discussion by the community at large I'd like to preemptively request that this post not be deleted.</p>
<p>I think this is one of the best subs on reddit and want it to be successful and safe for everyone. Thanks for reading and I look forward to everyones responses.</p>
<p>Edit: Alright then. Rule 1 no longer applies. Shake your moneymakers, guys. The sub has been monetized, the goal has been achieved. It's just like /r/fullmoviesonanything now.</p></p>

        <p>As I said in my first few posts after the account deletions I am testing it to see if it makes any difference &amp; if so we may need to change the rule, I never said everyone should do it. And I'm not doing it because of that, previous to this big take down I had been losing links sometimes hours after upload &amp; post, that's what I'm trying to combat. And per your request I have approved this post, it will not be deleted.</p>

        <p>Ok, well since I didn't see the first few posts you made after the account deletions I wasn't aware of that information. A post in the subreddit would probably have had more visibility. But thank you for the information. Also no one is suggesting you told everyone to do it. However, if people (including you) are doing it, and their posts stay up then you are telling them to go ahead and do it. Because you're one of the moderators.</p>
<p>So, just to clarify, rule 1 doesn't apply anymore? I ask because people aren't following it and their posts are staying up. </p>

        <p>No one is freaking out. Are you freaking out? I brought up an issue with the sub, in a polite and civil manner, where people aren't following the rules. It's not a radical idea.</p>
<p>People have tried these solutions. There are posts up right now, and before now, that weren't removed. There are posts that didn't use anything that are still up. It's unfortunate you didn't actually read what I wrote because I pointed all that out already. Whether I try it on one of my own uploads is irrelevant.</p>

        <p>I'm very, very scared about websites with lots of ads on them (or force popups even though I have three adblocks installed, etc, like so many file hosting and link hosting sites are) so I don't like the idea that people are posting "MEGA" links that redirect elsewhere before you can get to them. Granted, I usually check where a link is going before I click on it but I'm still worried about it, not that I actively download that much currently (and I haven't seen any examples of this yet luckily) but still. I like the idea of having agreed on sites though, maybe we should start putting our links somewhere safe like Pastebin, put through a link shortener (NOT like Adfly, like Google's link shortener or something we know we can trust) and with the key to the link in a seperate Pastebin post that we link to from here. If it ever gets really, really bad. My posts are very rarely taken down and I just seperate the link and key so I'm personally never gonna go the whole 30 yards like that for now but. That's just an example of what we could do that wouldn't bother <em>me</em> personally, someone who has very deep issues with paranoia especially with technology lmao. Idk if anyone is already doing that</p>

        <p>I don't follow monetized links or join monetized communities on principle. Yeah, it's stupid to have a line like this considering how immensely immoral it all is to begin with, but it's my line, and goddamit if I'm willing to die on said line. r/Megalinks was one of the first -and only- non-private-tracker sites I'd found that seemed to hold those same values, especially the mods; it's been really disappointing to see that that isn't as true as I'd thought. </p>
<p>For the record, I think the whole idea of having dedicated mods and uploaders on here is a bit ridiculous. You upload what you've got, and if you have something someone else wants, you share it. The whole "I am a source of content, tf I am your leader" complex that's been building over the past few months is getting reeeally old for me, hence why I'm calling it quits. Yeah, cue the "bye, felicia" memes and whatever, but so it goes. I've had some damn good times on the sub, and met some damn interesting folk, but things run their course, and you gotta go with the flow, I always say. Once again, peace, and hope it all goes well on this sub's end.</p>

        <p>I thought you were leaving.
Stop crying and go. It's doing no one any good, you hanging around trying to get the last word in. Don't you have any self respect?
Your attempts at going out in a blaze of glory are making you look like a whiny passive/aggressive little brat.
Just go and be done with it. </p>

        <p>Holy Shit. People will find anything to complain about, no matter how minute, when they're getting stuff for free.
Biggest example of the "Self-entitlement" generation if I ever saw one. </p>
<p>Uploaders, keep doing what you do, however you have to do it for the time being. You do a great job, and I appreciate the work you do immensely. Thank you. If I can help, I'll do so.
