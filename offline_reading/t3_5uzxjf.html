    <strong>[Question] Mega Security and Privacy</strong>
    <p><p>Hello!</p>
<p>Do any of you here on the subreddit use a mega premium account to download files?(tv, movies, etc) I've got a premium account and have always used it for this purpose as it's much more convenient than Megadownloader 1.7.. I typically just use Jdownloader because it's compatible with mega premium users. However, I've got a few concerns about the security of these accounts. I know there are multiple ways to purchase a plan on Mega (bitcoin, credit-card, vouchers etc..) Are any of these dangerous to use? I'd imagine that using a credit card wouldn't be a great way to pay for a premium account as it's linked directly to you. Is it much safer to use an option like bitcoin, resellers, or vouchers? </p>
<p>Also, I use my mega account for both personal use, and to download things from this subreddit. Would it matter if I had personal files in the cloud on my main account, and still used the main account to download things from this subreddit? That's what I was doing for the longest time, but wasn't sure if there were any privacy concerns to doing so? I enjoy having my premium account for my personal files and for downloads from here. Technically it shouldn't matter because it's all encrypted, right?</p>
<p>Lastly, I noticed that mega logs your last 250 sessions, name, email, and included what IP addresses have logged into your account. Is this information available only to you? I've always used a VPN when downloading, however, I've also logged into my account without one before. What would happen if mega stopped your account for downloading copyrighted content? Would there be any real consequences or would you just receive an account ban? </p></p>

        <p>Dangerous how? Even if they go after Mega (again), it will be to prosecute those who run the website. </p>
<p>As for lawsuits, they didn't attempt to sue any of the users, so that's not a risk either.</p>
<p>The only risk I see from any of this is if you were to store irreplaceable files on Mega, they might become inaccessible the way they were on the previous Mega. Apparently some people stored business documents (huh?) on it, and now those are sitting in some warehouse unpowered while the US government argues that they shouldn't have to pay for storage.</p>

        <p>Back in the good ol' days of Megaupload I had a bunch of family pictures in my premium account.</p>
<p>I second the irreplaceable documents thing...</p>

        <p>The copyright absolutists are in a pickle. If they purchase tyrannical laws, people will not tolerate it, and copyright itself might be in danger. If they purchase non-tyrannical laws, there are too many "loopholes" that make those laws pointless.</p>
<p>So instead of buying laws, they just buy prosecutions. For instance, Kim Dotcom hasn't committed anything that they can extradite him for <em>even if the allegations are all true</em>. The treaty doesn't allow for extradition for criminal copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Same with whatshisface in the Ukraine. kat.cr had a working DMCA notice system, and routinely pulled down torrent listings when notified. Jesus christ it was bad, some things you had to get in the first hour, or you'd never get them at all. This is enough to make it so that kat.cr wasn't a criminal operation.</p>
<p>Did that stop them? No. Apparently if you piss off people who are "important" enough, you can be prosecuted for abiding the law.</p>
<p>They don't care how much damage it causes either. </p>
