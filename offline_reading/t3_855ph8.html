    <p><p>no.99: <strong>The Three Generals</strong>  </p>
<p>Stephanie Clifford's lawyer brought breaking news to Morning Joe, says his client was physically "threatened" | After the firing of Rex Tillerson, Trump's other generals still in the administration - National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, Chief of Staff John Kelly, Defense Secretary James Mattis - start getting worried about Trump's actions | The timeline of Rexit doesn't add up, bringing the anchors to question whether Tillerson was fired for his Monday evening anti-Russia comments | Late in the evening, Andrew McCabe's fears became reality, and two days before retirement he was fired by Sessions, risking his pension | Did you know there was another Russian death in the UK this week? It gets investigated as a murder by British counterterrorism | New Trump legal filing seeks to move the Stormy Daniels lawsuit into federal court, and it picks a lawyer who went against Gawker in the Hulk Hogen sextape trial  </p>
