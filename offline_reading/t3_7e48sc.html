        <p>Hey there, 
I was just wondering really a question for the mod team, I try and go through and find as many links that are still live for people as possible from the weekly request thread (hopefully this helps the community a little). And often time I do find old dead links, is it helpful for anyone if I report older links as dead, so they can get tagged again? Or should I just keep doing what I am doing? </p>

        <p>Yes, in JDownloader at least, you can set this up in your settings. </p>
<p>Under Settings&gt;Account Manager, you can add accounts from several different sites, including MEGA. Add your credentials and your account will take a second to authorize. You can then start enjoying your account benefits through JDownloader, and check your remaining bandwidth on the Account Manager page.</p>

        <p>if you're on linux and use an openvpn based vpn, it's very easy.  you just need to send it a kill signal and it'll reset itself.  after that, it's all down to what you want to check for</p>

        <p>You can use Megadownloader.It seems to still be able to bypass the bandwidth limit especially if you start multiple downloads all at once.It only seems to check the bandwidth when it starts downloading.I know some people say it doesn't work anymore but I can get 50gb down overnight without problems.Just import the links from your free mega accounts using the get link feature in your Mega accounts.Or just copy the Megalinks while Megadownloader is open &amp; it will grab the links for you in much the same way Jdownloader2 does.</p>

        <p>I notice now that Handbrake includes 12bit x265 binaries in the latest distributions people are encoding using it. There's zero benefit to doing so, in fact it means most people can't watch your encodes on their TV boxes or even their computers if their CPU isn't the latest gen and they don't have a GPU that decodes it. Yeah, 10bit is good with an 8bit source because of dithering but you won't notice any improvement with 12bit so please don't use it. Just because it's a higher number doesn't mean it's better. 12bit isn't new either - it's been around almost as long as the 10bit binaries but you haven't seen many 12bit encodes around before now because it's pointless.</p>

<p>Or maybe if you want your submission to reach the widest audience it's safer to stick with settings that are already commonplace and familiar to users.  </p>
<p>Also, maybe lecturing submitters to stop using a particular format because it <em>might</em> not be usable to some unknown fraction of users is laughably arrogant.  If <strong>you</strong> can't play 12bit on your current setup either go shopping for appropriate upgrades or <strong>just don't download it.</strong>  Don't bitch and moan at encoders for creating it in the first place.  They aren't subcontractors.</p>

<p>You did one experiment, well done. We did dozens and found no clear benefit. How much CPU is your laptop &amp; Quadro using? GPU HEVC decoding wasn't a thing back then so it'll all be on your CPU meaning the GPU clock speed is pointless. If it can't be decoded by hardware then it does make it a pretty big obstacle for a lot of people. Playing 12bit is no problem for me but I already see sites being flooded with 12bit the same way it got flooded with bad 10bit stuff. Each to their own. I already wasn't downloading your rips because you stuck a 2gb HD audio track in btw.. just extract the core damnit, this format is about saving space :p</p>

<p>Audio bitrate varies with each of my rips.  Sometimes it's 600kb/s, sometimes 1500kb/s and sometimes 3000kb/s. AC3 uses the least and DTS tends to use the most.  If you've been skipping all of my rips because you think all passthru audio takes up 2GB then you've been wildly fooling yourself.  It's a little odd that one moment you've mastered the ins and outs of video compression and then the next moment you blurt out something like this.    </p>
<p>The format does save space.  It saves it via more efficient video compression which imho leaves room for passthru audio while still coming in near or under the 5GB cap that I try to respect, for users who don't have paid mega accounts.  But this outburst is about users with weak hardware and how a handful of uploads posted days apart is ruining their viewing opportunities.  Are you trying to be ridiculous or is this all an accident?</p>

        <p>I hit a nerve, all I felt like doing. These encodes you're doing are pretty much just personal I guess? If you're part of a group you generally do it for the masses, at least that's the way most people look at it. I ain't going to say who I'm with but I was just trying to point out how people jump on whatever is newest. I'm all over the place because I'm on the train but I can try to dig out the test stuff if you want me to rebuild an array. I suspect you don't really give a shit but I can also show you plenty of big dtsma tracks too. You're right, I'm wrong, clearly. The whole argument is stupid, I was just trying to point out that there will be a flood of dogshit as there always is with "new" codecs. Wasn't talking about your rips in particular, more the 900mb shitrips we're going to get and confusion about hardware decoding. Anyway yeah this is stupid and I'm sorry I said anything. Just keep ripping the way you want and I'll keep doing the same. :) </p>

<p>Sort of.  I'm doing encodes that I would want to have and I post them believing/expecting that some users will be happy to grab them.  I post the file (and soundtrack and book if I can find them) and I also keep it for my htpc, namely the laptop.  I've never been part of a group and this is my first time posting content anywhere in about ten years.  </p>

<p>Except you spent most of your post attacking 12bit with generalizations and exaggerations.  And you didn't say a word about low-bitrate encodes.  And you did it right on the heels of my 12bit submissions which are 2/3 of the 12bit posts on this entire subreddit.  And you wrapped up by taking a swing at <strong>all</strong> of my encodes with a bullshit remark about the audio streams.  If your goal was to warn about Yify-style postings, you hid it well.  Next time try opening by saying what you mean.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suspect you don't really give a shit  </p>

<p>I'm curious about it but it doesn't keep me up at night.  When I noticed the 12bit switch in the latest Nightly build I did some Googling but found almost zero coverage.  Just a few people asking about settings.  I thought that was weird but not necessarily a bad sign.  So I did the <em>The Brave One</em> rip and was very pleased with how it turned out.  Then I did the Preview samples that I posted about, to see how 12bit compared.  This was on one desktop using one CPU, not on an array.  If 12bit performs poorly on an array, that seems like an apples and oranges comparison to me, especially if it's using nvenc.<br>
It takes me about 20 hours to encode and another 20 hours to upload and I want to offer the best work I can without blowing the 5GB cap.  That's a lot of time.  If there's something about 12bit that compromises the work I'd like to know about it.</p>

<p>I guess. It's not necessarily low bitrate encodes, mostly people using qsv or nvenc, or using fast/med profiles. Or profiles at all for that matter. I found the audio thing amusing, like I've downloaded 6gb HEVC rips and almost half of it is audio. eac3to -core that thing man, ludicrous. I did most of my 12bit encodes on 8 cores and did notice it was a bit different from 10bit which tops out at about 16 cores. The main thing I found was, from memory, loss of detail in background dithering or whatever other people call it. The dark areas that stick out in 8bit - 10bit smooths them out but 12 smoothed them out too much and background details got lost. On skin too, though it's not like 10bit does a great job there either. Realistically 8/10/12/69, whatever.. it's still in development so anything could change in the future but atm I don't believe 12bit offers any benefit beyond filesize and encoding time. Not sure it has received the same love so far in development as 8 &amp; 10 but time will tell. </p>

        <p>No there isn't the only "limit" per say is you having enough storage on your mega account. You used to be able to add a 250gb file to a 50gb account now that isn't the case.</p>

        <p>You can still do it, you just have to use the MEGASync client and select 'import links'. It will let you go over the 50GB that way, the only drawback is that only the first link that goes over the limit will work, anything after won't.</p>

        <p>/u/vcdupper /u/indigo6alpha /u/iPhunwa2, 
I think it would be a good idea to either have a stickied thread or something to remind people that they should try and do a search within our sub before requesting. yes many of us already do this automatically but with the rapid growth we have gone through in the last year alone it would be cool. </p>

        <p>may be in the minority here, but I almost feel like doing this repeatedly or making a request with a bunch of stuff that's already been posted and still alive (showing you made no attempt to search) should earn them a ban temp or permanent, i don't really care.  </p>
<p>the req threads are just polluted with requests for things that have been posted previously (and still alive) followed up with comments from good souls like /u/gossetsguy pointing them to the links.  don't know how he has the patience to do what he does. </p>

        <p>While I think it would be a great idea to try and get people to search more before they post in the weekly request thread I don't know how we would moderate between the people who missed something, forgot to remove a character from the decode, and those who just didn't search at all you know? I think we should definitely encourage searching more, but I think one of the reasons this community is so cool is that it bring a bunch of people together with the intent of helping people out, for no reason but the kindness of their hearts so I would hate for people to miss out on that just because they didn't search deep enough (and I think we all remember a time when reddit's search algorithm barely worked at all so it's understandable people not wanting to use it) but I think encouraging it's use more would be awesome though! 
(Also I'm really not that patient, I just feel bad with how much I have taken from this sub, and not giving back that much so I try to do what I can to help!)</p>

        <p>no, I get it.  it's hard to weed out and everyone who uploads does it out of no personal gain.  But at the same time (I'm sure I'm not the only one who has noticed) that there's been a huge influx of people to this sub.  That brings the good and the bad.  More people willing to chip in and upload whatever they got along with some people who just want stuff spoon fed.</p>
<p>we've all seen the req thread go from 400 ish posts a week to 400 posts in a day.  Rhetorical question here: how many of those you figure are already fulfilled but someone was too lazy to search.</p>
<p>yes, the reddit search is god awful still (tho better than it used to be) but you can ALWAYS use the site: feature in google.  In fact some subs recommend the use of that for searching the subs due to how awful the reddit one is.</p>
<p>the thing about failing the intelligence test is at the end of the day it's PEBCAK.  I'm not suggesting we go instabanning people.  There's always honest mistakes, but in the case of messing up the decode, why wouldn't they just ask for a reup or ask if anyone still has an import to share in the original post?  Wouldn't you think that'd get more attention from people who have/had the content?  </p>
<p>the other thing that bugs me is people asking for stuff that pretty much doesnt exist.  Bluray rips of in theater movies, 1080p content for stuff that's never been released/upscaled properly (there's  tracker search sites that dont get your ISP on your ass and scene search engines, why not use them?)</p>
<p>I suppose it just comes down to me feeling the sub would benefit if people would find ways to help themselves (or attempt to help themselves first) before asking for help.  It'd help everything grow if people like you spent more time finding good shit online and informing us instead of finding old things already posted here.  I mean if you could do it, why couldn't they?</p>
<p>hah, look at that, I ended up a bit wordy too :)</p>

        <p>Yeah definitely those are some great points and perspectives you are bringing that i definitely did not consider, thanks for sharing them and bringing them to light! I think there definitely are ways to tell that people didn't do a whole lot of searching, and it can be pretty obvious if they aren't asking for RE-UPs, which could really help the sub because there might also be a lot of people that think the content is dead forever. </p>
<p>Haha and I'd say I unfortunately know the answer to that rhetorical question too well, there are definitely tons of request made every week that has live copies around,but I think a lot of those people are either new here with no idea how this works, or they just didn't find the one live link in a sea of dead ones. Maybe one solution could be the mod who posts the weekly request thread (not that I want to make the mods lives any harder, they already do an awesome job!) could have a weekly copy and paste that they put into the body encouraging people to search before they post, so that when people are in the request thread they will think to search before paste huge longs list that has a lot of hem up already!
I will agree asking for copies of stuff that are not out there, does really bug me a lot because I have spent time hunting for things before that I had no chance of finding because it was released that day and I didn't realize it until a minute or two into searching. I would love for people not being allowed to request things in the weekly request thread unless it was available at the time of their post (which would also hopefully include the people who request popular tv shows a couple hours before airing, I'm sure we all love getting those copies as soon as we can, but at least give it 24 hours before you start requesting it, but that's just my opinion who am I to judge!)</p>
<p>I think we can all just agree that we want the sub to continue to be awesome and continute to grow in a hopefully managable pace, and hopefully these discussion help us help the mod team do it! </p>
<p>Thanks for the discussion friend I appreciate hearing your unique perspective, just also know it will be a long time before I get tired of helping out in the request thread!</p>

<p>it used to be there.  but I think the mod/mods realized it was a lost cause.  haha!</p>
<p>the problem with the huge long list pastes was that once the req thread started to pick up some "smart" people thought it'd be better to spam single posts, which went and got them yelled at.  Then more "smart" people started combining the big laundry list of stuff with some cherry picker items (basically things that are popular and they know/think will get them upvotes).  And now there's posts with 50 some odd random things.  There really was no win-win in this case!</p>

<p>with you on this one too.  Rick and Morty came to mind.  People would be requesting it at the top of the request thread before it was even done airing!  The other half of this is I'm assuming a lot of the people who don't search also aren't aware of any of the scene or torrent searches, so it'd be hard to convince/show/educate</p>
<p>And thank you for the discussion as well. Glad all of the mods here come across real chill and kind of just let most things go and police/fix themselves.  As you said, it's a community about giving for the sake of giving.  I'll still never know how you manage to help out so many people over in that req thread.  I open it, get a few posts down, roll my eyes and move one.  I consistently say to myself "wow, this guy/gal has got patience" when I see your posts over there</p>

        <p>Hello all, new uploader here.  I've been lurking here at this sub for the better part of three years and I finally am starting to give back.</p>
<p>I created a new, separate reddit account strictly for the purpose of uploading here. So far today every time I've tried to post a link to this sub the body of my post just says <strong>[removed]</strong> - is this an automatic thing for new users?  Is there a time frame for when it stops being an issue? So far I've messaged the mods after two of my posts to get them pushed through the spam filter, but I don't want to have to message them every single time I upload.  Any help would be appreciated!  I have loved coming to this sub for the last few years and I look forward to being a contributing member to this community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Text/Link post<br>
Account age &gt; 7 days</p>

<p>You do not satisfy that rule (yet), which is why your posts have to be manually approved. Likewise, the comments you've posted weren't approved either because of the requirement for comments (mentioned in rule #5 as well) but I've approved them now :)</p>

        <p>I use chrome. I went to Mega.nz and logged in my account, but even there I couldn't find the MegaSync link.</p>
<p>Googling it returns results from sites like softonic and I don't exactly trust them. </p>
<p>Edit: Solved it. I had to open an incognito window under Chrome to get to the landing page for mega.nz, and downloaded it from there. Weird af. </p>

        <p>Hi friends. New user here. </p>
<p>Is setup vpn a good vpn to use? I've used the windscribe one but sadly I missed out on the   extra gigs per month and 10gb isnt enough for the movie I want. </p>
<p>Or is there a better way to bypass the bandwidth limit?</p>

        <p>Setup vpn has a data limit then it bans you for 24 hours.I could never find out for sure what the limit was but it is probably only 10gb or so.</p>

<p>i know i'm new, but since i move data a lot and don't have a lot of space, just let me know if a link i submitted is dead or no longer working and i'll try getting the data back in working order. i know the link i posted a week or so ago will be dead. FYI i randomly received the Reddit Chat feature, so i guess if you need to get in touch with me PM or chat...</p>

        <p>In fact, you only need to extract it once as /u/exhippy mentioned. Just right click on the first file (part01.rar) and choose "Extract Here" and they should all start extracting. Once you're done with the extraction process, you can delete all the .partxx.rar files :)</p>

        <p>Yes.The downloads will resume so long as you don't close the browser.Just pause the download &amp; change the ip address every 3-4 gigs.Cycle between the cloud &amp; dashboard buttons, in your mega account,a few times to check how much has been downloaded on the new ip address before resuming the download.  </p>

every word space seperated

        <p>This is more of a request, but I figure it belongs here.</p>
<p>Can we slow down on the x265 content? Uploaders, I know some people are encoding x264 to x265 to make it a smaller size, and I appreciate it, but my Raspberry Pi doesn't. I use a Raspberry Pi 3 as a Kodi machine, and it doesn't play well with x265. So, if possible please can we focus on x264? I have actually left /r/megalinks for this reason (Don't believe me? Check my reddit account.)</p>
