        <p>Not to come off as ignorant, but does it really need to be linked every time anyone talks about Avatar? The last time someone mirrored your links they went into detail about the subreddit and the remaster etc etc. so I figured that would be good enough exposure for anyone that was interested in that type of thing. Your group did great work on the project and I wouldn't have bothered a) downloading it, b) re-encoding it to x265 or c) uploading it for people if I didn't think so.</p>
<p>All I'm saying is taking offense over me not explicitly plugging a subreddit or giving credit past trying to name the group in the title (see ReATLA; I wasn't sure what to call you) is a little silly. I wouldn't do that for any of the material I upload here. You can feel free to do that yourself in the comments, as you have here, but there's no real need for passive aggressiveness.</p>

        <p>Not everytime anyone mentions Avatar, of course not. That would be silly. But when <em>specifically</em> our 1080p remaster is mentioned in a different, unrelated subreddit, yeah, atleast mentioning it would be nice. That's just my opinion of course.</p>
<p>ReATLA is <em>kinda</em> vague for people who don't know anything about this remaster. RemasteringATLA would have been perfect. Call it nitpicking, but that would have been a lot clearer imo. I don't see any harm in posting a comment underneath your thread linking our sub though. Like you said, you bothered downloading, re-encoding and uploading everything... but mentioning a subreddit was too much to ask? I really do appreciate the kind words, but that sounds a bit contradictive to me. I'd say it's common courtesy.</p>

        <p>I would say download an episode and compare for yourself. Screenshot comparisons are very nearly identical. There is a very, very small loss of detail that really is only noticeable when viewing side by side. I can add a couple screenshot comparisons later tonight anyway.</p>

        <p>The only comparison you showed is pretty much a still frame with not a whole lot of motion in it. [This] (http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/194192) is what I would call a proper worst-case scenario comparison. Dark scenes will look worse, there's no denying that. Take a look at the sky, wall, or their clothing for example. Compared to the original release it's full of compression artifacts during such scenes. So saying they look ''very nearly identical'' is kind of misleading imo. Atleast be fair and point out both the good <em>and</em> bad things.</p>

        <p>I realize your goal is something like archival (and that's fine) but most people don't want/need quality at the level of 6000kbps, the same way I don't store all my music in WAV files (FLAC at best, 320kps MP3s mostly, and sometimes less, as the difference is <em>not noticable</em>). Of course I expect that for all the music I listen to, there are beautiful lossless magical files stashed somewhere at the record label (i.e. your versions) and it saddens me when that doesn't exist (e.g. butchered Morrowind audio CDs, and to a lesser extent now ATLA). But for my purposes, the compressed versions are all I need.</p>
<p>This guy isn't telling people who are interested in the best possible quality to forget your release and go with this one, it was created for OP's personal use and shared for people who just want some compressed versions of your files, and for that purpose it's great. "Very nearly identical" implies some minor quality loss, and that's exactly what we see here. "Very nearly identical" is spot on, in my opinion. It's not like OP said "completely identical, original encoders are idiots lol". I'm not sure why you're so concerned that strangers halfway across the world might have to endure seeing some extra compression artifacts on a dark wall. It's fine if <em>you</em> don't want that. But personally, I'm short on harddrive space and have terrible eyesight.</p>
<p>I really appreciate all the work you guys did with the upscale, and I'm very <strong>very</strong> excited to give it a watch over the holidays, which you guys have just made ten thousand times more awesome. But you gotta take a chill pill, dude. We're all just fans of your work and of ATLA. :)</p>

        <p>If you want to go with a compressed version that's totally fine. All I'm saying is that OP is making his h.265 re-encode sound better than it actually is. I guess our opinions of "very nearly identical" are different then. It is pretty subjective after all. I would consider this significant quality loss. For all I care people can downscale it to 480p again at 500kbps bitrate. I really don't mind. What I do care about is the encoder saying it's nearly identical to the original encodes, because that clearly isn't the case from what I can tell. That's my only concern.</p>

        <p>Hey man, I'm super grateful you and your friends made this, but I don't think OP is in the wrong here except for not crediting you, which might just be an honest mistake since he might have figured you didn't stand anything to gain from more views as you don't gain money from it (again, really appreciate what you've done for everyone). </p>
<p>But here all OP said was "There is a very, very small loss of detail that really is only noticeable when viewing side by side." which, from what I can tell, is largely true. I don't think he's making it sound better than it is, that was a pretty fair and honest response on his part, at least in my opinion.</p>

        <p>I appreciate you and /u/LastArabesque trying to rebut with some sense here. I'm honestly not trying to make this sound like it's anything more than it is, which is an x265 re-encode of the remaster. I never said it looked better, or even as good, or anything of the sort. From the outset I said there's minimal quality loss compared to the original, as should be expected with all re-encodes, especially when going from x264&gt;x265. I think Scyrous is being overly pedantic and nit-picky when saying that I'm misrepresenting the quality of this encode by claiming that. I don't have access to their master files to do a straight x265 encode from source, which I'm absolutely sure would look better than what I'm offering here.</p>
<p>I also added the "worst case" comparison to the OP. I'm not trying to convince anyone that anything is better than anything else; that's pointless and completely subjective. It's also nonsensical to even suggest - what do I care who downloads what? I'm just giving people an alternative, should they want it. If someone wants to archive the highest quality possible, then you obviously go with the original 64gb release. If you want a very high quality:size ratio and are okay with not having literally <em>the</em> highest quality, then I think what I've done is a very passable alternative for those wanting that type of thing.</p>

        <p>If you have the NTSC DVDs, you actually do have access to the same 'source'. I am not saying you should, but if you were so inclined, you could run the script posted on their release page yourself, changing the H.264 settings to H.265. That way, you are not re-encoding per se. It would be as if they encoded their 'remaster' in H.265 in the first place.</p>

        <p>Total praise to you for making these re-encodes, but may i ask why you made all this effort and only uploaded it to mega, and not to a torrenting site as well? A lot less people are acquiring the files that you spent all that effort on because of the way you uploaded it. I realise you can just reply with 'do it yourself' but im not trying to be rude, just asking why not?</p>

        <p>I don't have the resources to constantly or even begin to seed a torrent. My ISP monitors torrent activity heavily so I'm not about to join a swarm when I can just upload to a file-sharing site with no worries of repercussions. It's uploaded to Mega because this is the mega subreddit. I don't gain anything from any additional effort on my part, of which I've already dedicated enough imo, but if anyone else wants to seed the files in a torrent, go for it.</p>

        <p>Try another extractor, or another browser, or use Megadownloader instead. For what it's worth, they were zipped with WinRar.</p>
<p>No one else has reported any such issues with any of the episodes after many, many thousands of episodes have been downloaded.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reencode, the 1GB filesize of the original files was overkill, not to mention the 1080. it should have been 720p since it's an upscale, and they had problems with the deinterlacing, but damn the waifu2d or whatever it's called filter is pretty good.</p>

        <p>I'm not affiliated with the group that did the remaster at all, nor did I change any of <em>their</em> files. If they want to do a proper x265 encode using their own source files that they have access to and I don't, they can do that. I did this re-encode for personal use and decided to upload it, so take it or leave it. I don't really need anyone's permission or have any obligations to re-encode already available content.</p>
