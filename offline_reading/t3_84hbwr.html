    <strong>[Comics] Fleetway's Sonic The Comic (Complete)</strong>
    <p><p>This is every issue of the UK's Sonic The Comic published by Fleetway, as well as the specials, poster mags and annuals ("Yearbooks").</p>
<p>Each issue up to #139 had multiple stories in them, but from #140 they changed one of those to reprints. By #157 there was only one new strip each issue, until #185 where it changed to all reprints. So although there were 223 issues, #185-#223 are only new material - which basically just means the covers.</p>
<p>That's why the higher archives have more issues in them: there was less content to fill them.</p>
<p>The archives are around 250MB each, and in the 7zip format, so make sure you have something to unzip them with.</p>
