    <strong>[E-BOOK] Gaunt's Ghosts series by Dan Abnett (Books #1-#13)</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Requirements: EPUB/MOBI Reader, 12.3 MB</strong></p>
<p><em>Overview: In the blood-soaked Sabbat Worlds Crusade, the massed ranks of the Imperium battle the dark forces of Chaos for dominion. At the forefront of this conflict are the Imperial Guard – untold numbers of ordinary soldiers fighting to preserve the Emperor’s holy realm. Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt and the men of the Tanith First-and-Only are at the heart of this struggle. Forced to flee their planet before it was destroyed by Chaos, their specialist scouting role has earned them the nickname the 'Ghosts', along with any dangerous mission their commanders deign to throw at them. Read about their adventures in Dan Abnett's bestselling Black Library series.</em></p>
<p>Genre: Sci-Fi</p>
<p><strong>1. First And Only</strong>
In the nightmare future of Warhammer 40,000, the galaxy-spanning Imperium is riven with dangers. In the Chaos-infested Sabbat system, Imperial Commissar Gaunt must lead his men through as much in-fighting amongst rival regiments as against the forces of Chaos. First and Only is an epic saga of planetary conquest, grand ambition, treachery and honour.</p>
<p><strong>2. Ghostmaker</strong>
The tide of war begins to turn in the Sabbat Worlds Crusade as beleaguered Imperial forces begin a fierce counter-offensive against the dark armies of Chaos. For Commissar Ibram Gaunt and the Tanith First-and-Only, it is the beginning of a battle that may force them to sacrifice not only their lives, but their very souls.</p>
<p><strong>3. Necropolis</strong>
On the shattered world of Verghast, Gaunt and his Ghosts find themselves embroiled within an ancient and deadly civil war as a mighty hive-city is besieged by an unrelenting foe. When treachery from within brings the city’s defences crashing down, rivalry and corruption threaten to bring the Tanith Ghosts to the brink of defeat. Imperial Commissar Ibram Gaunt must find new allies and new Ghosts if he is to save Vervunhive from the deadliest threat of all – the dread legions of Chaos.</p>
<p><strong>4. Honour Guard</strong>
Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and the Tanith First-and-Only are back in action on a shrine-world of the deepest tactical and spiritual importance. But the vile forces of Chaos will never allow them to hold their prize for long and, as the counter-attack rages, Gaunt is sent after the most priceless relic on the planet: the ancient remains of the saint who first led humanity to the Sabbat Worlds.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Guns of Tanith</strong>
In the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, the heretical forces of Chaos are fighting back hard. Dangerously overstretched, their supply lines cut by degenerate enemy troops, the Imperial forces grind to a halt. Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and the Tanith First-and-Only must recapture Phantine, a world rich in promethium but so ruined by pollution that the only way to attack is via a dangerous – and untried – aerial assault. Pitted against deadly opposition and a lethal environment, how can Gaunt and his men possibly survive?</p>
<p><strong>6. Straight Silver</strong>
On the battlefields of Aexe Cardinal, the struggling forces of the Imperial Guard are locked in a deadly stalemate with the dark armies of Chaos. Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt and his regiment, the Tanith First-and-Only, are thrown headlong into the living hell of trench warfare, where death by an unseen enemy is always just a moment away. The only chance for Gaunt and his lightly armed scouts to survive is to volunteer for a mission so dangerous that no one else dares accept it!</p>
<p><strong>7. Sabbat Martyr</strong>
With the future of the Sabbat Worlds campaign balanced on a knife edge, new hope arises in the form of Saint Sabbat herself, reincarnated to lead the Imperium to victory against the dark forces of Chaos. The living saint calls for Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and the Tanith First to be her guardians. Doubting that she is who she claims, Gaunt must discover the truth while fending off enemy troops and lethal assassins. But treachery within the Ghosts will not only threaten the mission, but will rip the Tanith asunder.</p>
<p><strong>8. Traitor General</strong>
An Imperial general has defected to the enemy, and the secrets he carries could spell the end of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and a small team from the Tanith First must infiltrate an enemy-held world and gain the trust of the local underground, all the while trying desperately to avoid the ever-present taint of Chaos. Their mission: to stop the traitor general from revealing his secrets – by any means necessary.</p>
<p><strong>9. His Last Command</strong>
The Tanith First are no more. Moved into another regiment under a charismatic new commander, the loyalties of the former Ghosts are put to the test when Colonel-Commissar Gaunt, long believed dead, returns. As the enemy overrun the Imperial forces, Clashing with Crusade command, and suspected of harbouring the taint of Chaos, Gaunt must fight not only to be reunited with his Ghosts, but to stop all their lives being thrown away in an unwinnable war.</p>
<p><strong>10. The Armour of Contempt</strong>
Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt spent a year fighting as part of the underground resistance on the enemy-held world of Gereon. When he left, he promised that he would bring the forces of the Imperium to liberate Gereon’s citizens from their oppressors. Now he has returned, a crusade army at his back, but he finds a world devastated by war and a people irrevocably damaged by the taint of Chaos. Now Gaunt must fight to save Gereon not only from the enemy, but from the Imperium itself.</p>
<p><strong>11. Only in Death</strong>
The Sabbat Worlds Crusade has reached the fortress-world of Jago, and the Tanith First are given a vital – and dangerous – mission to defend a key pass against the enemy. Garrisoned in an ancient mansion – the Hinzerhaus. Strange things are happening there. There are voices on the wind and people are disappearing. With enemy outside and ghosts within, Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and his men must face their fears – for only in death does duty end.</p>
<p><strong>11.5. The Iron Star</strong>
The Iron Star, by Dan Abnett, is an exclusive, stand–alone Gaunt’s Ghosts short story. Released in September 2008, it’s limited to 1,200 copies, and will be available at UK Games Day, from the Black Library webstore, and at the 2009 US Games Days, until stock runs out.
Set between the events of Only in Death and the forthcoming novel, Blood Pact, The Iron Star follows Colonel–Commissar Gaunt and the Tanith First and Only across an unknown and mysterious warzone. Here, they face the their old foes, the Blood Pact. But how are long–dead Ghosts able to fight at Gaunt’s side against the enemy, and who are the watchers? The key to it all lies in unravelling the mystery of the iron star.</p>
<p><strong>12. Blood Pact</strong>
The Tanith First have been pulled back from the front line and are enjoying some well-deserved rest. But that is about to end. An enemy prisoner – one of the deadly Blood Pact – wants to betray his masters, but he will only talk to Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt. Can he be trusted, and what exactly does he know? Gaunt must discover the truth and avert a deadly threat to both his own life and to the Sabbat Worlds Crusade itself.</p>
<p><strong>13. Salvation's Reach</strong>
The Tanith First-And-Only embark on a desperate mission that could decide the fate of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade in the thirteenth book of this popular Imperial Guard series. The Ghosts of the Tanith First-and-Only have been away from the front line for too long. Listless, and hungry for action, they are offered a mission that perfectly suits their talents. The objective: the mysterious Salvation’s Reach, a remote and impenetrable stronghold concealing secrets that could change the course of the Sabbat Worlds campaign. But the proposed raid is so hazardous, it’s regarded as a suicide mission, and the Ghosts may have been in reserve for so long they’ve lost their edge. Haunted by spectres from the past and stalked by the Archenemy, Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and his Ghosts embark upon what could be their finest hour… or their final mission.</p>
