    <strong>[DOCUMENTARY] Four Corners - Betting on the house: Australia's real estate obsession driving us to the brink (21Aug2017) [ABC] 288p x264 (144MB)</strong>
    <p><p>This is the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/betting-on-the-house/8816724">download from Four Corners' website</a>. ABC is the <a href="http://about.abc.net.au/who-we-are/the-abc-board/">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>This documentary focus on the impending and seemingly inevitable Australian house market collapse.</p>
<p>Too much leverage from gamblers (generally referred to as investors) (borrowing as much as they can, ignoring risks, consequences, and believing that there will be a next fool to whom they may sell for more than they paid themselves), too much greed from banks (lending as much as they can, to whoever accepts the risk), too low interest rates.</p>
<p>Those are the perfect ingredients for what will be the aussie version of the 2008 GFC.</p>
