        <p>I honestly don't know which of these are feasible or not but here is what I got. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For request posts, some sort of flair so that if a link is provided in the comments, people know. Sort of like how ELI5 and OOTL have "Answered" flairs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New qualifier for posts: USLD or AOLD. "Used search links dead" or "All other links dead". This shows that while the person requested something common, they at least went through the effort of searching first. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe a way to report dead links to nominate them for deletion? Nothing worse that searching for a movie, finding it, and then seeing the link has been taken down. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We obviously need a weekly GoT sticky. Every week at least 2 hours before the show, there's already a request thread for it. Maybe the sticky could be a place for everyone to dump their GoT weekly link for the day, since it's never just one person doing that weeks episode links. Keeps it all in one spot, nice and tidy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe a weekly "rerequest" sticky? If you made a request during the week and it got ignored, you get another shot in the re request thread? That way you don't have to make another request thread. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should make an official rule about what the bear minimum a submission title should have. Maybe uploaded can discuss amongst themselves, but I think [Type] Title Resolution and Size should be the standard. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any more I can think of and I'll edit them in. </p>
<p>EDIT: In regards to requests, I think they have a place here. If this is where the uploaders are, this is where the requests need to be. The other sub is dead, and forcing people to make requests there just splits the sub. Plus, if uploaders want to oblige requests, now they have two subs they have to go to. </p>
<p>With that said, I know there is a way to do subreddit filtering built in to a subs CSS. I'm not sure exactly how it's done, but take a look at the sidebar of r/squaredcircle for an example. If we could implement a "requests on/off" switch, I think that would satisfy everyone. </p>
<p>EDIT 2: Regarding request flairs, perfect example would be /r/outoftheloop Answered/Unanswered flair system. That flair is changed by the user once the questions has been answered on OOTL, same could work here. A Unfulfilled/Delivered switch maybe?</p>
<p>Also, going forward, once we get a feel of where we want to go, we should definitely have a sidebar with rules/guidelines on it, not just with the sister subs on there.</p>

        <p>AutoModerator can remove the posts without '.co' in the links and post a comment notifying the user about the requirement. Kinda like how your post gets auto-removed when the post title doesn't contain a tag ([TV], [REQUEST] etc) </p>

        <p>Again I'm not entirely sure how this would be implemented, but I put this comment on the thread announcing you as a new moderator. </p>
<p>*Couple of ideas, some might have been posted already but here goes:</p>
<pre><code>Get people to use URL shorteners to prevent links being taken down so quickly.

When large groups of files are uploaded, they get combined into a single post instead of hundreds of posts.

All requests are automatically moved to the mega requests subreddit, if all requests are there then people are more likely to look through it.

A way of reporting dead links so that the posts can be removed.

Once posts containing dead links have been removed, a listbe madekf removed links so that they can be re-uploaded.
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure how possible some of these ideas are but I thought I'd post them anyways to see what can be done.*</p>

        <p>I've just had a little look and though I don't know much about how reddit works, especially on the moderator side for you automating things. It's possible that you could create a Google forms 'survey' in which people can report links that are down and then something can be done about removing them without having to check every post on reddit all the time, and a list could be made from all the submissions say once a month for uploaded to look at and re-uploaded popular ones.</p>

        <p>In regards to encoding type, I think h265/HEVC should be prioritized. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkzk-AYdbt0">Here</a> is an example of the difference between h265/HEVC and h264 at 320kbps. While the file size of h265/HEVC is slightly larger, its quality is significantly better than the h264 version. With the right settings when encoding the movie/TV show, a smaller file size can be achieved with higher video quality when using h265/HEVC codec.</p>
<p>H265 works in VLC and MPC-HC (for older/lower end hardware), so compatibility shouldn't be an issue for most people.</p>

        <p>That youtube video can't be right. The difference isn't <em>that</em> drastic. </p>
<p>Also, youtube's own encoding should fuck up the quality more than any standard encode ever could.</p>

        <p>YouTube's encodings would affect both videos equally, so any differences in quality can only be a result of the original encoding. [Here] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2016/01/h-dot-265-slash-hevc-vs-h-dot-264-slash-avc-50-percent-bit-rate-savings-verified) is further evidence that h265 is a better codec.</p>
<p>In any case, yes, you are correct that the difference between h265 and h264 for most releases is not as noticeable as in that YouTube video, but that's primarily because the bitrate is <em>much</em> higher than 320 kbps for basically any watchable release. At higher bitrates (see [this comparison] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL22L0mRSDs) at 1024 kbps), the differences are not as noticeable but are still undeniably there. Plus, for the vast majority of h265 releases I've seen, the file size is drastically smaller than the comparable h264 releases, but the quality is still better.</p>

        <p>Ok, you've definitely convinced me that H265 is better. </p>
<p>I think other than that, we should encourage at least 2GB per hour, so 4GB for a 2 hour film, since anything below that really gets noticeable. </p>
