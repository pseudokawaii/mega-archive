    <strong>[TV] MSNBC: Tueday, 13 March 2018 (PA-18 Special Election Coverage) [360p WEBRip | x264 | AAC] [3.92GB]</strong>
    <p><p><em>lol, so much for delays...</em>  </p>
<p>no.96: <strong>Rexit</strong>  </p>
<p>Trump fires Rex Tillerson via tweet (anything to not look the victim in the eye while pulling the trigger), picks CIA Director Mike Pompeo as his successor, who needs to be confirmed by the Senate first | Meanwhile, the new potential CIA Director Gina Haspel has to face her past as the director of a CIA black site in Thailand, which encouraged torture and the visual recording of it, which apparently was destroyed with her assistance | Tillerson was not the only one fired today, as Trump's "body man", a Rob Porter lookalike named John McEntee, was also given the way to the exit doors | New court order puts Paul Manafort in a 24-hour-a-day lockdown mode, while the possibility of him spending the rest of his life in prison gets more solid | Rick Saccone and Conor Lamb face off in the soon-to-be distinct 18th district of Pennsylvania, with cable news treating this special election like the one in GA-6 | House GOP declares no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion | Roger Stone says he was in contact with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and now Robert Mueller is eyeing that information | Rachel Maddow's Trump Administration Departure board adds a third column, five new names  </p>

        <p>1) There are people who download everything (for archival purposes, of course).<br>
2) If there wouldn't be anyone downloading my packs, I wouldn't waste all these hours every day on creating a quickly accessible timeline of breaking news, which might be of interest ten or 20 years from now.  </p>
<p>And I'm serious about the second point. I recently found all editions of my country's daily evening news, starting with the late 1980s. I started downloading them, because I would love to know what was important to the nation back then, which wasn't taught to me in school. It's a different kind of history lesson, and even viewing experience. And considering I became interested in American politics in 2014, I would love to get to know that world from before I opened my eyes to it. I would be happy if someone had recorded early 2000s cable news shows and they were still available to watch today.  </p>
<p>Yes, right now all of the downvoters (and there seem to be a lot of them) side-eye me with my posts, but in ten, 20 years, when we're all still alive and I'm still doing this (wait, what?) or other people are still doing this, it's gonna be an interesting view into the past.</p>

        <p>This is so important. We are witnessing history. I started watching Rachel Maddow to understand <em>what the hell is going on</em>. I thought maybe other people would want to do the same, so I began sharing.</p>
<p>(In my country, the main news channel is funded by taxpayer money. Naturally, they have everything on tape since the day they began running news. They should make ALL of it available to the public.)</p>
