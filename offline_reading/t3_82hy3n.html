    <p><p>no.88: <strong>The Full Nunberg</strong>  </p>
<p>Former Trump aide Sam Nunberg goes nuts and has multiple meltdowns on live TV, when he got a grand jury subpoena by Robert Mueller | Nunberg first vowed to not comply to the subpoena, but after apparently daydrinking his way through MSNBC, Ari Melber and CNN, he flip-flopped like his former boss and decided to plan to show up in front of the grand jury on Friday - but will this be the end of the Full Nunberg? | Trump meeting Israel's leader Netanyahu in the White House | Senator Thad Cochran to resign due to health issues, opening up yet another Senate seat to be taken over by the blue wave | State Department yet to spend $120 million allocated to fight election meddling | West Virginia teacher strike now longest in history | A Russian escort, jailed in Thailand, says that audio recordings of Russian election meddling exist, and is therefore starting to ask for quid pro quos | Unpublished Steele memo says Russia blocked Trump from choosing Mitt Romney as Secretary of State  </p>
