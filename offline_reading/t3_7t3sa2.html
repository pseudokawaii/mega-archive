<p>Two reliable genres--submarine adventure and the threat of World War III--come together in director (and co-writer) Samuel Fuller's Hell and High Water, a 1954 film that remains surprisingly relevant more than half a century later. When an enormous nuclear explosion is traced to somewhere between the tip of northern Japan and the Arctic Circle, followed by the disappearance of a prominent French atomic scientist (Victor Francen), it's clear that something's up. Did the prof defect to the dark (actually, the Red) side? Was he abducted? As it turns out, he's actually part of a group of scientists, businessmen, and other distinguished gentlemen planning to send a sub to check out the scene and determine the extent of the threat. Enter Capt. Adam Jones (the redoubtable Richard Widmark), who agrees to helm the private, very secret mission for a hefty cash reward; enter also the professor's "assistant" (Bella Darvi), herself a skilled scientist who goes along for the ride, thereby quickening the pulse of every able-bodied sailor on board the sub, especially the captain's.</p></p>
