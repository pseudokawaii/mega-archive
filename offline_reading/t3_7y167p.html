    <strong>[TV] MSNBC: Thursday, 15 February 2018 [360p WEBRip | x264 | AAC] [2.91GB]</strong>
    <p><p>Thursday, 15 February 2018: <strong>The New Normal</strong>  </p>
<p>It has been 25 hours since the beginning of the last breaking news coverage of a mass murder | Florida shooting sparks new calls for gun reform | New calls for gun reform spark GOP comments about how gun reform couldn't have prevented this tragedy | Trump breaks silence about Florida (without mentioning the word "gun" in his speech), blames the shooting on mental illness, and conveniently forgets that, on 2/28/17, he signed into law a bill that would allow mentally ill people to purchase a gun - a bill that was finalized in December | Steve Bannon finally talked to special counsel Bob Mueller - for 20 hours | Because it didn't get any attention during the breaking news coverage, MSNBC repeats that more than 100 White House staffers are without security clearance, including top aides like Ivanka, McGahn and Kushner | Rick Gates close to plea deal with Mueller  </p>
<p>In this pack:<br>
<em> Morning Joe<br>
</em> Deadline: White House (hosted by Nicolle Wallace) <em>(panelist Dave Cullen was testing out MSNBC's Standards &amp; Practices during this hour, proving there is no 7-second delay in cable news)</em><br>

<em> Hardball with Chris Matthews<br>

        <p>OK... this is going to be weird. Is there anywhere to grab some Fox News programs?</p>
<p>To be clear, I find almost everyone on that channel except Shep to be laughable or enraging, but it might be interesting to contrast those programs with others. </p>

        <p>There is always Youtube, although cable news shows tend to not survive for more than a day or two there.  </p>
<p>I did however think about doing the CNN and FOX News primetime shows as a contrast (for more I simply don't have the time to edit and upload them), but I never really figured that people want to have them. After all, the only cable news shows that get peered in the world of torrent are those from MSNBC...</p>

        <p>Holy shit. I didn't realize you do this yourself. Don't worry about it. I was just curious.</p>
<p>Thanks for your efforts! </p>
