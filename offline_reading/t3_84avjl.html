    <p><p><strong>PSA</strong> <em>My source currently seems to have trouble getting the cable news shows up; their availability has been delayed by almost a day. Chances are this will continue for a while until they have caught up on whatever they were doing. So don't wonder if the packs will be up much later than usual for the next few days/weeks. I'm hoping this will resolve itself quickly. Plus, maybe I should start working on my 99% disk usage problem, which I continue to have and causes me encoding slowdowns.</em> <strong>PSA</strong>  </p>
