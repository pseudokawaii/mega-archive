<p>Album Description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emerging from the tight-knit South London dubstep scene, Oliver Jones has been producing and DJing for a global audience for more than a decade. He has continued to expand his palette into new territory, both on his own and as part of Magnetic Man with Benga and Artwork.</p>
<p>From 2006 onwards his ‘Stella Sessions’ on Rinse FM became a platform for devoted fans to hear new material, much of which can be traced onto forums and Youtube rips across the web. On a legendary radio station that still serves as one of the key platforms for underground music in the UK, he sustained a reputation as a tastemaker presenting the latest sought-after dubs, many of which came from his close friends.</p>
<p>A prolific producer, he has acclaimed EPs and albums on Tempa, Tectonic, Big Apple, Soul Jazz, Exit, Digital Soundboy, Greco-Roman and Harmless amongst others, as well as his own Disfigured Dubz imprint.</p>
<p>FABRICLIVE 96 is a playful journey through the house, techno and disco he has explored in more recent years. Ricocheting percussion and bold textures build a formidable energy that is rowdy at times, visceral at others. Stripped back cuts like Bufiman’s ‘Peace Moves’ and Alex Kid’s ‘Yonqui’ establish a groove before making way for peak time bombs like Floorplan’s cathartic ’Made Up My Mind’ and Radio Slave’s acid trance burner ‘Screaming Hands (Krautdrums Mix)’. Also featured are two new productions from the man himself, as well as entries from Hieroglyphic Being, Sascha Funke and a 90s gem from LA Synthesis.</p>
