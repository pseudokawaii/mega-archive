<p>Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are married and stuck in a minor rut. When Deborah meets an American tourist, their attraction is undeniable. Yes, I know, she has Cary Grant at home, so perhaps Robert Mitchum is the only man Hollywood could have cast to make her infidelity believable! Before long, Deb and Bob are having a hot-and-heavy affair, and to help him deal with the problem, Cary recruits the advice of his faithful butler Moray Watson and his flirtatious friend Jean Simmons.</p>
<p>Every part of this movie is cute, even the song during the opening credits and Hardy Amies’s beautiful costumes. The script is very funny, with a mixture of jokes, wry one-liners, and situational comedy. I’m not even a Deborah Kerr fan, but she’s just as delightful in this movie as her three co-stars.</p></p>
