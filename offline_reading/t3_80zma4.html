    <p><p>no.82: <strong>Particularly Manipulable</strong>  </p>
<p>John Kelly's new security clearance policy is in full effect, and Jared Kushner's clearance gets downgraded, loses acces to rop-secret intel - but what about the other 100-or-so White House staffers? | Turns out that Kushner was being manipulated by at least four countries, due to his inexperience as a foreign adviser, as well as shady connections with international businesspersons | NSA director repeats FBI Director's words: "I have not" been directed to disrupt Russian election hacking | Hope Hicks facing House investigators for multiple hours, not answering a lot of questions | Two more red seats have turned blue in special elections, the number now up to 39 since December 2016  </p>
