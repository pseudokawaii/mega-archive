<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A space adventure series set 400 years in the future that follows The Orville, a mid-level exploratory spaceship. Its crew, both human and alien, face the wonders and dangers of outer space, while also dealing with the familiar, often humorous problems of everyday life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>S01E08 Into the Fold</em></p>
<p>Ed and the crew set out to save Dr. Finn, her two sons and Isaac after their shuttle gets thrown into unchartered space and they crash-land on a moon that is light years from the Orville.</p>

<p>Alternatively, may I suggest paying for a streaming service if instant access is what you seek?</p>

<p>You sure can and nobody will stop you, provided the episode has <em>just</em> aired seconds ago &amp; it still is rather hard to get. I'm sure people won't mind waiting for a few mins for the link to be available, while those who can't wait will go for the alternatives provided until you can make the link available. Also, not to mention not everyone rushes to get it just after airing, many people will download when it's comfortable for them &amp; so these posts will be up for a long time.</p>
<p>But you know what'd have been better instead? To simply wait while it was being made available. Like I suggested, paying for the content you consume will make sure you're getting proper quality at proper times with no delays.</p>

<p>Ah, the old "If I assert a thing, that makes it true" argument. A near-100% accurate way of being 100% incorrect while being 100% insecure and 100% lying about accidentally transposing (and/or otherwise fucking up) a URL.</p>

<p>Of course, and when there is an available link, I will click on it, and be 100% justified in being annoyed when the result says "COMING SOON".</p>

<p>I think that applies to you as well when you say the link doesn't work. Let me state this once, it works perfectly fine. If you want to say otherwise &amp; repeatedly so, then make sure you also make a screenshot available instead of shamelessly ranting about it.</p>

<p>I think it's established that it wasn't a blank post just because the link I provided didn't work for you, actually, I'm still not sure if you bothered to actually try it. Also, quoting me out of context is NOT the way to justify your incessantly ignorant behaviour.</p>

<p>I never asked you to pay for my uploads, I'm asking you to get the $8 Hulu subscription so that you get your content on time if that's your worry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shame I'd have to wait until someone actually had links to the next Orville before they told us they had it, though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, to clarify, I apologise if my behaviour was anything more than discomforting. I posted the post before I had the link available, granted I did provide 2 very convenient &amp; popular alternatives, which was all I had at the moment. My intent was to provide the content to those who want it ASAP, and my hope was that they'd go for the mirror links while those with a bit of patience &amp; understanding would be able to wait until it was available on Mega. As I said formerly, this makes sure we don't end up with redundant posts by different uploaders &amp; serves as a message that the links will be here &amp; that they should be assured that someone was working to provide it to them ASAP. It's better to come here &amp; search to find a post of the <em>just now aired</em> Orville episode than to see none at all. Even if it ends in disappointment, in that case, I'll direct you to the source if you want it faster than I can provide. Which, btw, is one mere Google search away, which'd have been easier to do than what you did. This behaviour will not get you very far, and it's for your best that you learn to appreciate what you clearly didn't work for. Not to mention, this post was not tailor made for you, and nobody offered you instant availability, neither asked for your attention. I would recommend you don't reply to this, and enjoy the few minutes late episode you just procured with some popcorn.</p>

<p>Dude, tbh, as someone reading this exchange between you and OP, it's you that's sounding rude and ungrateful here. </p>
<p>First you say there were no links. Now there was one but it didn't work.... so why not say that? And you're upset that the other links were still uploading?? Why not be chill while you wait for them? Why waste more time on all this arguing.</p>
<p>Edit: I understand you an OP came to a resolution. That's great to hear. </p>

        <p>I'm not being smug. I'm just calling you out for being an entitled little shit.  If you don't like the way OP posts his content, feel free to go make it yourself. You're literally doing nothing for the community other than complaining. So next time you decide that OP's post confuses you and that you're unable to understand the concept of patience, do us all a favor and kindly shut the fuck up.</p>

        <p>You can put all those things on me, but none of them are true. All I asked is why he made a blank post that essentially said "coming soon!" instead of just waiting until there was content available. I wasn't rude, I wasn't insulting, I, without bias, very plainly asked why he'd make an empty post. </p>
<p>Anything beyond that is you adding your own commentary. You're unable to understand the concept of nuance, do us all a favor and kindly shut the fuck up.</p>
