    <strong>[MUSIC] 1979 - 'A Certain Sacrifice' Soundtrack (Madonna's first feature) The Inferno Music Vault</strong>

<p>From the info document included in folder:</p>
<p>A Certain Sacrific is notorious for being the very first artistic project that future pop-diva Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone dipped her toes into after running away to New York City with only $20 to her name.  Madonna actually wrote a three-page letter to the director, Stephen Jon Lewicki, begging for the part. Which was odd, because the role did not pay any money at all. Well, she did wind up being the only person involved in the film to be paid any money, but it was only $100, because she was behind on rent and was on the verge of eviction. The film was shot in 1979, but wasn't released until 1984, purportedly to "cash in" on Madonna's blossoming mega-success as a pop star. Madonna was actually at the screening, and when the film ended she stood up and yelled "Fuck you!" and stormed out of the auditorium. She even went as far as to try to sue Stephen Jon Lewicki and stop the film from being released. She lost. Now, that alone should make you a little curious to see this film, right? </p></p>
