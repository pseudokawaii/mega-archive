        <p>Thanks for the UL!</p>
<p>But I have to laugh...Gordon is shocked...OUTRAGED even, that there is a "hidden" epidemic of coke use in the restaurant biz (welcome to 25-30 years ago). Either he's disingenuous to absurdity or making fun of everyone in that biz....  </p>

        <p>Gordon Ramsay's brother suffered from a crippling cocaine and subsequent heroin addiction. I really don't think he sees any humour in drug addiction. It's probable that such a second-hand experience of it could make him both passionate and naive about it.</p>

        <p>He's mentioned his brother in other series and during interviews, I was amazed HE was still so amazed at coke's prevalence. I am aware this is a passion piece for him, but I fail to understand how a man with so much passion into all sides of his business with total of 16 frickin Michelin Stars awards could be so...unobservant.</p>

We had our blow (stepped on or not) and weed (hydro, what is THAT?), and LSD and X (totally made in 6 semi's that drive around the country.) You kids don't know how hard it was to get high!! Nancy Reagan was in charge!! And she said "Just say no!"</p>

        <p>I have to admit I was pretty disappointed in this show. What I was hoping for was some kind of wacky, over-the-top animated series featuring a cartoon version of Gordon Ramsay snorting copious amounts of cocaine and being even more obnoxious and offensive than he normally is with no restraint whatsoever.</p>
<p>I was imagining some scenes where Ramsay gets angered by some idiotic customer or employee and due to the effects of copious amounts of cocaine our man Gordon is no longer able to muster even a modicum of restraint and begins a rampage of hellish fury. He begins throwing utensils and cutlery, grabs an underperforming sous-chef in a headlock, kicks a mewling customers teeth out, and begins punching anyone he can reach in the face.</p>
<p>The violence escalates with Ramsay rampaging through the restaurant and into the city proper, with only brief lulls for him to do even more cocaine, during which he will narrate to the camera his thought process as he serves his vengeance on the populace. He doesn't kill indiscriminately, targeting those who deserve or who commit social grievances or annoyances. He kicks a man in the balls for cutting in line. A jaywalker receives a flying spin-kick to the jaw. As Ramsay stumbles onto a group of yobs harassing an old woman he begins to metamorphose and the cocaine feeds his rage into a form of insane, superhuman strength.</p>
<p>He punches one offender, knocking his head clean off. Grabbing another miscreant Ramsay rips the man clean in half, lengthwise, then throws both halves at two fleeing members of the yob group, killing them both instantly. Shrieking with fury, unable to be sated, Ramsay injects cocaine directly into his eyes as he heads to Piccadilly circus.</p>
<p>Alarms sound, the police are called. Billy clubs and tasers are useless. Ramsay has ripped his clothing apart, only slightly covered in shreds and tatters. His rippling, muscled physique, powered by unfettered cocaine fury is the envy of all men and the desire of all women. </p>
<p>The army arrives and opens fire. Bullets are futile against the Ramsay-beast, ricocheting dangerously into the neighborhood around. Ramsays skin has begun to glow white hot. He haphazardly tosses cars and lampposts into buildings nearby. By this point he has repurposed a gas tank from a London bus into a backpack full of cocaine with the fuel line feeding directly into his spinal column. His shrieks can be heard miles away.</p>
<p>Crowds disperse and run for cover as Gordon Ramsay, the former chef and now Demigod of the Coca Leaf, has become brighter than the sun and cannot be viewed directly. Thousands are struck blind in an instant. Ramsay can be clearly seen backlit through the buildings and tenements in town. The army attempts to withdraw too late, casualties are horrific. Tanks and planes ignite and melt without ever reaching him.</p>
<p>As desperate Londoners futilely attempt to evacuate people begin to fall due to acute radiation poisoning. Ramsay has gone nuclear. As the prime minister attempts to calm the leaders of the U.S.A and Russia via the red phone, Ramsay detonates. London is destroyed. A once-thriving city is now rubble, a gutted, radioactive crater filled with broken ruins and hot rubble. </p>
<p>At ground zero, a crater hundreds of feet deep full of molten slag and gamma radiation bursts lies the corpse of Gordon Ramsay and his epitaph. His final words he carved into solid rock with his bare hands moments before his death. It says: "Don't do drugs, kids."</p>
<p>This, in my opinion, would have been a much better show. </p>
<p>A+++++++, would watch again.</p>
