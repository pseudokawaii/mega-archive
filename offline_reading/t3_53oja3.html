<p>Starring Rob Brydon (Gavin &amp; Stacy) as Keith, a taxi driver who records a monologue on his video camera, which relates the story of his failed marriage after his wife Marion left him for her work colleague, Geoff. The script is written in such a way that the viewer can pick up on clues that Keith has not himself realised - it's a gradual process as Keith eventually realises that which is already self-evident to the viewer.</p>
<p>Keith's character is affectionately portrayed as a gentle dunce and draws a great deal of sympathy as the series progresses. He is in denial about his divorce, and somehow always manages to look on the positive side of even the most awful situation. Although he doesn't understand it, his life revolves around Marion and her new partner Geoff, and his love for his "little smashers" (his sons, Rhys and Alun). Despite his faults, Keith is a hard-working and good man.</p>
