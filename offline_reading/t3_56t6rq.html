<p>On the surface, The Royle Family appeared to be humdrum and low on incident - but such ordinary appearances belie the fact that it was a groundbreaking work of exceptional comedy invention. Writers Craig Cash and Caroline Aherne's knack of capturing every nuance of character and dialogue made the sitting room of the titular Royles a must-see for an ever-growing audience. Viewers simply dropped in to this Northern family's conversations and watched them channel-hop and discuss various everyday subjects.</p>
<p>Family patriarch Jim Royle is master of his space - unafraid to rearrange his nether regions, pick his nose or fart, regardless of the company. Ricky Tomlinson embraces the part with gusto, making Jim's oft delivered "My arse" a national catchphrase. Frequently boorish, always laughing at his own jokes, and intent on announcing his lavatorial visits to all and sundry, Tomlinson made Jim impossible to dislike.</p>
<p>Because of Jim's indolence, it is his hard-working wife Barbara (Sue Johnson, reuniting with her former Brookside husband) who is the main breadwinner. She is the only one who sticks up for their oft picked-upon youngest son Anthony who is obliged to do any errand or drudgery without complaint.</p>
<p>Their daughter Denise and her henpecked husband David are ensconced on the family sofa even when they have a house of their own, as is Barbara's morbid, storytelling mother Norma (known as Nana).</p>
<p>All the characters in this show just seemed so right. The laughs appeared to come effortlessly (although, ever the perfectionist, Aherne reportedly agonised over every syllable), and there was no contrivance or slapstick to be found anywhere. The Royle Family mined comedy from the mundanity of life, and brimmed with affection for its characters. Although infused with occasional moments of sentimentality, it was unflinching - never afraid to portray its characters with all their flaws apparent.</p>
