    <strong>[TV] Cosmos: A Personal Voyage (1980) [Carl Sagan] - 384p DVDRip(?) x264 5.6GB</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Cosmos</strong>: <em>A Personal Voyage</em> (1980)</p>
<p>Carl Sagan's highly influential series about space and humanity.</p>
<p><em>We are a way for the cosmos to know itself</em></p>
<p>English subtitles muxed, German and Spanish as separate SRT files.</p>
<p>And as a bonus, "A Dialogue Between Carl Sagan and Ted Turner", a separately released full-lenght interview that was unofficially supposed to be Episode 14 of the series (<a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/28230/late-movies-carl-sagan-interviewed-ted-turner">info article</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The series was first broadcast by the Public Broadcasting Service in 1980, and was the most widely watched series in the history of American public television until The Civil War (1990). As of 2009, it was still the most widely watched PBS series in the world. It won two Emmys and a Peabody Award, and has since been broadcast in more than 60 countries and seen by over 500 million people. A book was also published to accompany the series. Cosmos: A Personal Voyage has been considered highly significant since its broadcast; David Itzkoff of The New York Times described it as "a watershed moment for science-themed television programming"</p>
