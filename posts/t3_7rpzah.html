    <strong>[E-BOOK/PACK] The Maze Runner Trilogy - Books (#1-3) by James Daschner</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Book #1 - The Maze Runner:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his first name. His memory is blank. But he’s not alone. When the lift’s doors open, Thomas finds himself surrounded by kids who welcome him to the Glade—a large, open expanse surrounded by stone walls.</p>
<p>Just like Thomas, the Gladers don’t know why or how they got to the Glade. All they know is that every morning the stone doors to the maze that surrounds them have opened. Every night they’ve closed tight. And every 30 days a new boy has been delivered in the lift.</p>
<p>Thomas was expected. But the next day, a girl is sent up—the first girl to ever arrive in the Glade. And more surprising yet is the message she delivers. homas might be more important than he could ever guess. If only he could unlock the dark secrets buried within his mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>==========================================================</p>
<p><strong>Book #2 - The Scorch Trials:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solving the Maze was supposed to be the end. No more puzzles. No more variables. And no more running. Thomas was sure that escape meant he and the Gladers would get their lives back. But no one really knew what sort of life they were going back to.</p>
<p>In the Maze, life was easy. They had food, and shelter, and safety . . . until Teresa triggered the end. In the world outside the Maze, however, the end was triggered long ago.Burned by sun flares and baked by a new, brutal climate, the earth is a wasteland. </p>
<p>Government has disintegrated—and with it, order—and now Cranks, people covered in festering wounds and driven to murderous insanity by the infectious disease known as the Flare, roam the crumbling cities hunting for their next victim . . . and meal.</p>
<p>The Gladers are far from finished with running. Instead of freedom, they find themselves faced with another trial. They must cross the Scorch, the most burned-out section of the world, and arrive at a safe haven in two weeks. And WICKED has made sure to adjust the variables and stack the odds against them.</p>
<p>Thomas can only wonder—does he hold the secret of freedom somewhere in his mind? Or will heforever be at the mercy of WICKED?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>==========================================================</p>
<p><strong>Book #3 - The Death Cure:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thomas knows that Wicked can't be trusted, but they say the time for lies is over, that they've collected all they can from the Trials and now must rely on the Gladers, with full memories restored, to help them with their ultimate mission. It's up to the Gladers to complete the blueprint for the cure to the Flare with a final voluntary test.</p>
<p>What Wicked doesn't know is that something's happened that no Trial or Variable could have foreseen. Thomas has remembered far more than they think. And he knows that he can't believe a word of what Wicked says.</p>
<p>The time for lies is over. But the truth is more dangerous than Thomas could ever imagine.</p>
<p>Will anyone survive the Death Cure?</p>
