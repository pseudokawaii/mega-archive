<p>Invicta Fighting Championships, the worlds largest, all-womens mixed martial arts organization, began in 2012 as the vision of longtime industry veteran Shannon Knapp. It was clear to Knapp that the sport of MMA lacked a major platform for professional female fighters to compete on a consistent basis.<br>
In April of 2012, the promotion hosted its first event from its base of Kansas City. The event streamed live and free on InvictaFC.com and proved to be a huge success. A second event followed in July of that year. The year ended with a major milestone as the first Invicta FC champion was crowned at Invicta FC 3 in the atomweight division.<br>
After a successful first year of operations, the organization continued to grow exponentially in 2013. Invicta FC 4 kicked off the year as the first event to air via online pay-per-view and featured the promotions inaugural strawweight title bout. In the spring, a flyweight champion was crowned, but that was only the tip of the iceberg.<br>
The promotions sixth event moved to televised pay-per-view in the United States and Canada. In the main event, the inaugural featherweight belt was awarded. At Invicta FC 7 in late 2013, the promotions fifth and final title was handed out in the bantamweight division.<br>
Following a busy second full year of business, Knapp appointed womenâ€™s MMA pioneer Julie Kedzie as matchmaker.<br>
More milestones followed for Invicta FC in 2014. The promotion secured a deal with UFC Fight Pass, becoming the first organization to have its events air live on the digital streaming platform. In addition to securing its broadcast future, all of the promotions past fight archive was added to the streaming service.<br>
At Invicta FC 8, the organization aired its first event on UFC Fight Pass and also added a sixth weight class, hosting its first lightweight contest. The fight card also saw the promotion crown its first champion from Europe, joining titleholders from the U.S.A. and Brazil.<br>
The growth of the promotion took another step forward in the second half of 2014, as the promotion held its first events outside of Kansas City. Invicta FC 9 ventured to Davenport, Iowa, while Invicta FC 10 emanated from Houston.<br>
Things have not slowed down in 2015, as the promotion kicked off the year with its first event in Los Angeles. It returned home to Kansas City for its 12th offering, but the promotion is expected to add Las Vegas to its list of host cities in the summer.<br>
While there are still many chapters to be written, Invicta FC is committed to pioneering the future growth of womens MMA by promoting the best possible match-ups, as well as identifying and developing future superstars of the sport.</p></p>

        <p>I don't know if you have access to them, but if you have Bellator events I'd love to see them on here in the future as well. Invicta is awesome, and that was a great card. I have fightpass just for Invicta and Eddie Bravo, but I don't have cable so I miss out on Bellator unless I get a crappy stream.</p>
