    <strong>[TV] Night of the Shorts: Sketchfest 2016</strong>
    <p><p>On January 7th, 2016, the comedy world was forever changed. Some said it was the sheer wattage of star power assembled in one place. Others said it was the relentless volume of hilarious jokes delivered from the stage of the Castro theater. But one comedy historian, speaking for the first time in months from a comedy hospital bed, simply uttered the the four words “David and Hazel....LIVE!” before slumping over. Clown doctors with oversized stethoscopes rushed in, but were unable to revive the patient with a rubber chicken IV. He was pronounced dead from acute laughter intoxication.</p>
<p>We are not saying that you will die if you don’t watch this show! In fact, we’re saying that you may die if you do… Hm, that could be worth revising. Eh, I’m sure one of our interns will get around to that! Anyway, what you have here is quite possibly our funniest Sketchfest Live show of all time! Chortle at the deterioration of a Canadian marriage! Slap your knee as horrible hell monkeys die one at a time! Howl with laughter at the sight of Ned Blandford!</p>
<p>Mike, Kevin, and Bill were joined onstage at SF SKetchfest Live 2016 by very special guest riffers Bridget Nelson, Mary Jo Pehl, Cole Stratton, Janet Varney, Adam Savage, Paul F. Tompkins, and John Hodgman including a gigantic, possible world record TEN PERSON riffing grand finale!</p>
