    <strong>[MOVIES] Star Wars & The Empire Strikes Back (original theatrical releases) 1080p AC3 x265 12bit hMCi plus OSTs and novelizations</strong>
    <p><p><strong>NUKED BY DMCA - LINK DEAD</strong></p>
<p>http://links.snahp.it/169.childhood.unruined  </p>
<p>Password is the name of this subreddit.  </p>
<p>The linked Mega folder includes both films, a complete soundtrack for each film and an epub of <em>The Star Wars Trilogy</em> <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Trilogy">collection 
of novelizations.</a>  You can pick and choose what you want.  The soundtracks are 
<em>complete</em> complete; 3 CDs for each movie.  </p>
<p>The first Team Negative 1 project was <em>Star Wars</em> (Episode IV) <a href="http://moviemezzanine.com/the-fans-who-saved-star-wars/">using original 35mm theatrical reels</a> that were purchased on eBay.  The film reels were supposed to be destroyed after a movie stopped showing so it was an extraordinary find.  They scanned the film in 4k using their own improvised rig and then did a manual, frame-by-frame clean-up of the movie.  This rip is my recode of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115223443/http://www.ahashare.com/torrents-details.php?id=1552144">10GB x264 8-bit torrent,</a> which is <a href="http://www.thestarwarstrilogy.com/starwars/post/2016/06/13/Star-Wars-Silver-Screen-Edition-Bluray">version 1.6.</a>  </p>
<p>Also note:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>getting the movie to look like an “official” release isn’t the goal. Instead of making Star Wars look better than it ever has, 
Team Negative1 has made an effort to preserve to look inherent to a theatrical print from the late-’70s. The idea is to let fans 
see what audiences would have seen in 1977, which means something a little softer, a little grainier, and even a little more washed 
out colour-wise than any official Blu-ray release would likely be.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Team Negtive 1's second release was <em>The Empire Strikes Back.</em>  This rip is from the 21GB blu-ray iso torrent.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “Renegade Grindhouse” version of ESB (sometimes called “Grindhouse version 1”) refers to Team Negative 1’s original 35mm 
version, released in January 2015. TN1 intended to clean it up in order to release a “Sanitized” edition, a bit like their Silver 
Screen edition of Star Wars. Sadly they disbanded before finishing the project, and as far as I know it is no longer being worked 
on.  </p>

        <p>The despecialized editions are reconstructions using pieces from various sources all sewn together.  A Frankenmovie.  That's why you see a version number on them.  </p>
<p>The TN1 releases are scans of original reels of the original movies that were shown in theaters and that a few someones squirreled away for the past 35 years.  Nothing has been altered or modified except for dirt and scratch removal.  No special editions.  Fans classify these films as a part of GOUT.  George's Original Unaltered Trilogy.  GOUT is the holy grail of Star Wars fandom.</p>

        <p>Scarcity.  Lucas seemed to want to make the original films fade from existence once the special editions got rolling.  The original movies were released on <a href="http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110316124030/starwars/images/e/ee/Laserdisclogo.jpg">laserdisc in 1993</a> and every release of the originals since then, on vhs and DVD, has been a copy of those laserdiscs.  No remastering.  The quality has been poor.  People haven't been able to work with the originals in HD because there hasn't been a source and even available SD sources were crummy.  People are spending hundreds of hours crafting and revising Despecialized versions because there is no other route to seeing the original films in their original form in HD.</p>
<p>[edit]Also, Lucasfilm announced at some point that GOUT could never be released in HD because the originals had not been properly preserved and were in too poor a condition to restore.  More than a few people thought that was horse****.<br>

<p>The special edition, that’s the one I wanted out there. The other movie, it’s on VHS, if anybody wants it. ... I’m not going to spend the, we’re talking millions of dollars here, the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn’t really exist anymore. It’s like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I’m sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be. I’m the one who has to take responsibility for it. I’m the one who has to have everybody throw rocks at me all the time, so at least if they’re going to throw rocks at me, they’re going to throw rocks at me for something I love rather than something I think is not very good, or at least something I think is not finished.</p>

        <p>You'd have to ask them.  I'd imagine that it's at least a little like any personal project that's had some success: you keep at it because you get some satisfaction from it and maybe other people do, too.  And as many posts here show, the TN1 scans don't seem to be well known.</p>

        <p>TN1 also used sources they weren't authorized to use, like Mike Verta's cantina restored parts. So it's kinda considered in bad taste to use the TN1 version.</p>

        <p>Nope. I'm sure you my mean source, since a reel only holds about 10 minutes of film.</p>
<p>And as someone that saw it in the theaters every other week, the prints were nowhere near that bad, so it's not an "original" experience.</p>
<p>There's quite a discussion about it at original trilogy. The discussion does not paint TN1 in a good light. They used more than one source for files, some without the permission. I think Verta was helping one of the guys, showing him how to do stuff, and one of the other TN1 guys just jacked the files Verta lent the guy here was training. Or something like that. It's been a while since it came out.</p>

        <p>I phrased it that way to avoid having the description get bogged down in details.  The interview I linked is similarly misleading when it refers to a single 'Spanish' reel as the source.  I just wanted to get the basics down and make the paragraph short.</p>

        <p>The intention is to preserve quality at a smaller file size.  That and doing a cpu encode instead of nvenc/QSV should leave us with an excellent-looking rip despite the 75% reduction in file size from the originals.</p>

        <p>If you encode 8-bit source as 12-bit, it still has 8-bit information in it no matter what. Correct me if I'm wrong but, what you say doesn't make sense to me in the slightest way. The only effect is that almost no one (including myself) can playback 12bit H265.</p>
<p>In addition to that, you end up wasting 4bit for nothing. How does that preserve quality at a smaller file size? Isn't that the opposite?</p>

<p>I think you're maybe misunderstanding the intent.  I'm not trying to improve the quality.  That's impossible.  I'm trying to preserve the existing image within a much smaller file.  <a href="https://kametsu.com/topic/54531-8-bit-vs-10-bit-encode-critique-discussion/">This forum post</a> explains it.  </p>
<ul>
<li>8-bit requires more grain to cover up (ie. hide/camoflauge) banding due to the lack of a larger color spectrum being utilized. That additional grain results in more bitrate needed which results in a larger file size. So lets do the math. 8-bit = more grain, more bitrate, and bigger filesize to prevent the banding caused during compression in comparison to 10-bit video. This means 10-bit is capable of being compressed further, cleaned up more, etc... without as much banding caused as a result. Which is why 10-bit can be smaller file size, yet higher quality than an 8-bit counterpart if done correctly and properly dithered to 10-bit/12-bit/16-bit. </li>
</ul>

<p>Based on feedback so far and my own experience, the only people who can't view it are using either set-top devices, mobile devices or older versions of VLC player.  It's unfortunate that not eveyone can watch these rips, but it's also not like I'm keeping the originals locked in a safe.  Anyone so inclined (and able) can get the torrents and post their own rips of these films and make them more widely compatible.  </p>

<p>higher quality than an 8-bit counterpart if done correctly and properly dithered to 10-bit/12-bit/16-bit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I totally lost you there. From an 8 bit source you have to artificially blow up that 8bit to 16bit (just an example for the sake of argument, easier to do the math) thru dithering. That results in double the (uncompressed) data. That opens indeed the possibility to use higher compression on that 16bit data resulting in lower bitrate, but not lower than a 8bit encode. The result (final file size at comparable quality) will be roughly the same, if not bigger. In other words you blow the data up first, to then use higher compression. Thats a naive fallacy.</p>
<p>The purpose of higher bit depth is to store more information, not less. If your display device and source material is 10bit, its totally worth it to encode/archive in 10bit, which of course results in a higher bitrate, not lower. Higher bit depth (16bit and up) only makes sense in editing, but not content delivery formats like h265 (that is just my personal opinion).</p>
<p>BTW, I use the latest vlc (mac OS) and it doesn't work. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining, I appreciate your work, but what that guy said in the linked forum post makes no sense to me. And speaking of compatibility, 10bit is common on many modern devices/players, but not 12bit and up.</p>

<p>I still have no idea what you're saying.  Try ELI5.  </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't see what the display device has to do with it.  A lousy 8bit rip is going to look lousy on an 8bit or 10bit display.  A good 8bit rip <em>might</em> look good on a 10bit display.  A good 10bit rip will always look good on both displays.  Ditto 12bit.  Are you saying that encoding above 8bit is bad because the result looks too good for the display?  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>which of course results in a higher bitrate, not lower.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What?  It's up to the encoder to choose a bitrate appropriate to their goals.  How does choosing 10bit equate to a higher bitrate than 8bit?  </p>
<blockquote>

<p>What little I've read says that higher bit depth pays off when performing colour grading.  Anyway, I'm not worried about viewers' displays, although 10bit displays will become common with 4k tvs so there's a little bit of futureproofing there.</p>

<p>Of course not. If you really think that, you totally got me wrong.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Because it is more data. The bitrate is the amount of data that has to be read from the encoded file/source, which is after compression took place. As I said you can of course choose a higher compression rate to compensate, but again, that would be a naive fallacy, if your goal is a smaller file size compared to an 8bit encode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't see what the display device has to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A 10bit encode has an advantage on a 10bit display only, and only if the source (sensor, film, digital file) delivered 10bit (or more) information. If your display is 8bit, your 10bit data has to be converted to 8bit before it can be sent to the display (or the display controller does it). </p>
<p>Again, I'm talking about content delivery, not editing/grading.</p>
<p>I'm not a video production expert, but I'm in computer science and I studied media formats, encoding and quantization techniques extensively.  I don't know everything, so I'm open to learn more about the smaller-file-size-thru-higher-bit-depth-paradoxon. But for now, it doesn't make sense to me.</p>

        <p>I'm a dilettante and am not up to the conversation you want to have.  I can report on my choices and their results but I don't have the expertise to defend them with any depth.  I do know that I am mostly satisfied with the work I've done so far and the negative feedback tends to hinge on compatibility issues rather than the actual viewing experience.  I take that as encouragement that I'm generally moving in the right direction and my encoding variables continue to evolve.  The issues you've raised here feels a bit to me like arguing over what fabric is used in a t-shirt.  I mostly don't care.  The shirt fits, it looks good and it is comfy.  </p>

        <p>VLC 4.0 can play this. Nightly builds for MacOS . https://nightlies.videolan.org/build/macosx-intel/
Problem is if you have Linux. Then you must build VLC from source with --enable-x265 (Debian 9 https://pastebin.com/F1Ns2Rui ) .. That is experimental VLC. But works fine for me.</p>

        <p>This seems to happen to some people with 12bit and VLC.  I don't know of a reliable fix.  Make sure your player is up to date.  If it is, try a fresh install.  If that doesn't work, try Media Player Classic (works for me.)</p>

        <p>There are a few solutions elsewhere in the replies here to get VLC to play it.  Most TVs do not like x265, to say nothing of x265 12bit.  I would suggest connecting a pc or laptop directly to the TV to watch it.</p>

        <p>Might this be related to the change in Windows 10 that makes it send monitors content in the bit depth the monitors say they support? Because apparently many monitors get it wrong and ask for too many bits, leading to graphical errors. If this is the problem, you can change the output color depth to 8 bit in the Nvidia control panel (if you have an Nvidia graphics card). It worked for me when Project Cars 2 turned green.</p>

        <p>Empire was Episode V from the day it was released.  You're probably thinking of A New Hope, which was simply "Star Wars" until (there's some disagreement on the date, but generally agreed upon as) the 1981 re-release, when it became "Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope"</p>

        <p>Interesting, so Lucas planned to do prequels  back then? I imagine that seeing "Episode V" in a series that only had 2 movies at that point must have confused audiences </p>

        <p>I think it's mainly colour correction and grain removal. I've tried to download that version (1.6) in the past, however it's an extremely tedious process when working with .m2ts files (or for me at least).  [This page here] (http://www.thestarwarstrilogy.com/starwars/post/2016/06/13/Star-Wars-Silver-Screen-Edition-Bluray) should hopefully explain some stuff.</p>

        <p>I had a look at the rip and compared it to the first screenshot in that article, of C3PO and R2 in the corridor.  The rip does not have the orange mark, so I guess that means it's 1.6.  However, while the article says "new audio tracks" this rip only has two; one DTS and one AC3.  So there's still room for confusion about just what the source is.  </p>
<p>On a side note, I have two 35mm Star Wars files.  The first is 21.8GB and has a 45 second leader with a custom TN1 logo and a greeting to the viewer.  Its file is named <em>Star Wars A New Hope 30mm (1977).mkv</em> and it does have the orange mark.  The second file is 10.4GB and is titled <em>Star Wars IV - Silverscreen Edition 1080p.mkv</em> and it does not have the TN1 leader.  This is the file I used to encode.  Both files have only two audio tracks, DTS and AC3.  </p>
<p>So, to clarify, I encoded version 1.6 but I do have version 1.0 here as well.  </p>
<p>[edit] I managed to find the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0IiGBLY.jpg">original link</a> for the Silversceen release in my browser history.  Ahashare rest in peace.</p>
