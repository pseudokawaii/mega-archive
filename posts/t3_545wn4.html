<p>What are you doing tonight? Going out clubbing? Off down the pub with your mates? Drinking three litres of cider on your local park bench? Stop lying, you're not going out, so why not watch Not Going Out whilst not going out. Then if anyone ask you want you're doing, "not going out" is doubly right which will make you feel smug for no reason.</p>
<p>The series focuses on Lee Mack (who can't act) and so who plays a fictional version of himself; an unambitious man in his late thirties living as a lodger in a flat in London. Lee is a negligent, unmotivated layabout â€“ frequently between jobs, he spends most of his days on his couch watching television, or hanging out at the local pub with his best friend, Tim Adams (Tim Vine), an accountant who owns the flat that Lee is a lodger in. He is also noted for his cheeky wit, and having a very troubled relationship with his father, with whom he shares many traits, and who openly mentions that Lee was unplanned, and resulted in the end of his marriage. Very often, the only thing that can get Lee off his couch and active is his efforts to impress the girl of his dreams.</p>
<p>This would be a better series if Lee Mack stopped with all the pauses where he so wants to look at the camera and pull a Jim face because of the hilarious one-liner he just dropped (less complaint of this as the series progresses). But it's pretty good and worth watching if you're after an unchallenging pretty-much-by-the-numbers written-by-committee comedy like this.</p>
