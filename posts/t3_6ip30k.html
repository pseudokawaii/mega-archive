    <strong>[GAME] No$gba with DSi firmware dump for DSiWare emulation. Includes Legend of Zelda Four Swords Anniversary Edition and 14 other DSi games [RARE][191 MB]</strong>
    <p><p>EDIT: Ooops! I forgot to post the link! Silly me!</p>
<p>Decode this from base64:</p>
<p>aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWdhLm56LyMhRDFRZzFhSUQhMUtjY1BMaHJKYjdKMmRkVlgxM2NKUGVLMUNZV2lpUlVjRmRUR2tfdUl3OA==</p>
<p>This here is a VERY rare thing to find. Very few people have gone to the trouble of hacking their DSi's, and even fewer have uploaded dumps of their system. However, thanks to the kindness of /u/ndizzIe, YOU can now emulate a DSi with relative ease!</p>
<p>This zip file comes with No$GBA, which is a GBA emulator that eventually evolved into a DS emulator, and now is the only DS emulator that can successfully boot into DSi mode and play DSi ware. DeSmuME is far better at running normal DS games, but won't work with DSi games or DSiWare. Citra won't run DSiWare either. There may be some hope from the recently-started melonDS, Medusa, and GBE+ emulators, but so far, No$GBAis the only one that works.</p>
<p>This zip file also includes all the BIOS files needed, as well as the DSi dump (DSi-1.mmc). Inlcuded on DSi-1.mmc are the following games:</p>
<p>Sudoku (used for the hacking process. It's probably not in a playable state. I advise against trying to play it.)</p>
<p>Shantae: Risky's Revenge</p>
<p>Might Flip Champs!</p>
<p>Cave Story</p>
<p>Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition</p>
<p>Dark Void Zero</p>
<p>Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!</p>
<p>Petit Computer</p>
<p>Art Style AQUIA, BOXLIFE, and PiCTOBiTS</p>
<p>Aura-Aura Climber</p>
<p>Bird &amp; Beans</p>
<p>Paper Airplane Chase</p>
<p>I present this download to you completely unchanged from the version /u/ndizzIe sent to me (so be aware that any pictures that appear on the top screen were taken by him/her and not me).</p>
<p>FAQs:</p>
<p>Q: When I start No$GBA.exe, it shows a GBA boot screen. What do I do?</p>
<p>A: Go to "File" --&gt; "Cartridge menu (FileName)", and select a Nintendo DS rom. It shouldn't matter which one you decide. It'll boot to the DSi menu once you select it.</p>
<p>Q: Why is the audio so bad?</p>
<p>A: That's just the way No$GBA is. As far as I know, you'll just have to put up with it.</p>
<p>Q: Do you have permission to redistribute this, and release the source of this upload? And I have a DSiWare game that I'd like to play that's not included on this list. How do I play it?</p>
<p>A: Here's a quote, ad verbatim from /u/ndizzIe, after I asked him those three questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sure, why not.<br>
You can give me credit too, I don't think nintendo's gonna sue me or anything.<br>
Here's how to add more games, although it's kind of a pain (you'll have to delete some since the NAND is almost full)<br>
http://gbatemp.net/threads/release-twltool-dsi-downgrading-save-injection-etc-multitool.393488/page-27#post-7224955<br>
The "giant tmd archive" I mentioned is earlier in the thread, but I recommend reading all of it. You can mount the NAND image with OFSmount or something, but you'll need to decrypt it with Twltool first. The keys you'll need to decrypt the nand are in the footer, but you'll have to reverse the hex pairs in the ConsoleID to get it to decrypt. I made batch files to decrypt/encrypt the nand, <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/Qu1B5hLP">here</a> they are if that helps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have not tried this process out yet.</p>
<p>Q: There were a few DSi-exclusive games that were released on cartridges. Do those work?</p>
<p>A: No idea. I'll try them out if I can find them, but I suspect the answer will be "Yes, but no". I imagine that the games will boot, but I doubt that any camera emulation code exists in No$GBA. I might upload the roms of those games if I can find them, though.</p>
<p>Q: What should I do if Ihave another question that wasn't mentioned here?</p>
<p>A: /u/ndizzIe originally created <a href="www.np.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/6h4oa9/how_to_use_nogbas_dsi_emulation_features/">this post</a> on /r/emulation describing how to dump the firmware of an already hacked DSi. You should probably start by reading that post and some of the comments to it. However, PLEASE DO NOT POST IN THAT THREAD! /r/emulation will not tolerate discussions of piracy, and I don't want to be responsible for people bugging him/her. Please post in this thread instead, and I will attempt to answer your questions. I've attempted to make the link to that thread a no participation link in order to ensure this happens.</p></p>

        <p>I'm really having a hard time following how to inject another game into the NAND that this comes with. I've spent hours trying to get all the needed programs and files just so I can try to play AlphaBounce on an emulator, since it's not offered on the eShop anymore, and I can't redownload it from my previous purchase. Anyway, can anyone help break it down for me? [/u/ajshell1] (https://www.reddit.com/user/ajshell1) maybe?</p>

        <p>I think I've figured out out to inject the game properly, but it seems like the TWLtool isn't encrypting the NAND properly. Even without changing anything, decrypting and encrypting it causes it to not run in no$gba any longer. Is there something I'm missing?</p>

        <p>Thanks for this. I have been trying to emulate dsi for some time. 
A question: Four Swords goes ingame, but the map is kinda bugged, which makes it unplayable. Does it happen to everyone else or just me?</p>

        <p>Ok. Seems like i'll have to stick to the gba version. 
At least Shantae is working without any bugs.</p>
