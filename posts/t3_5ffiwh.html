    <strong>[META] Internet Download Manager and MegaDownloader questions.</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>What happens when the trial runs out? Is it like WinRar where you can continue using the software or are you locked out of it?</li>
<li>If the latter, is it possible to uninstall and reinstall to get the trial period again?</li>
<li>I have a lot of shows I want to download for permanent storage but downloading by getting a link per episode would take a long time. Should I buy a Lite account for a month so I can quickly download everything I want? If I am correct, than I can download 1Tb worth of content in a month with the Lite account correct?</li>
<li>If I do buy a month of Lite, is there a potential of being caught for downloading content from Mega.nz?</li>
<li>In general, even downloading without paying, what are the legal ramifications/worries of downloading content from Mega? How does it compare to Torrenting? If I download a movie from Mega compared to torrenting it, I'm still download content that I didn't pay for.</li>
<li>Unrelated to the above questions, IDM no longer pops up to allow me to download stuff from Chrome. I didn't want to use it in place of Chrome's downloader built-in manager but I did like being able to download Youtube videos, especially long ones and watch in my own time. How do I re-enable that feature.</li>
</ol>
<p>P.S. Downloaded Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 as I enjoyed it a lot on 360 and wanted to replay it in all it's PC glory, completely different game with different gameplay. More like Arma than how it played it on PC.</p>
<p>P.S.S. I have a huge ebook collection of various topics, genres, reading levels. I would like to share it here as it's the only thing I have to share and wanted to know the best way of going about doing that. Should I create a separate account from my main one and upload there?</p></p>

        <p>1 &amp; 2. Torrent the cracked version of IDM. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yeah. You could if you have the money to do it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't think so. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basically the same. File sharing is file sharing, regardless of it being done through p2p or not. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to &gt;options - &gt;general - &gt;Make sure that there is a tick in the check box for chrome </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, sharing files is always encouraged. Creating a dummy mega account for uploading is advised. I do the same thing with my uploads. Download Megasync and just add your uploading account on it. Then &gt;right click on the folder you want to upload - &gt;Choose Upload to mega </p>
<p>I think you know how to share mega folders already so the rest shouldn't be an issue. </p>

        <p>To answer your 5th question, keeping copyrighted content in your own drive is no big deal. The trouble from MEGA comes when you share it with other people. And by trouble I mostly mean that your links are taken down for copyright violation. As far as downloading goes, it is not the same as downloading from torrent at all. Due to encryption from MEGA, your ISP's don't know what you're downloading.All they know is that you're downloading <em>something</em> from MEGA but they don't know that it's copyrighted material or not. So unlike torrents, downloading movies from MEGA won't get you in trouble with your ISP.</p>

<p>won't it incur problems to MEGA? Like it happened with megashare or other file sharing websites?</p>

        <p>The people owning the copyright can to MEGA whenever they see copyrighted content shared over it. And they do, that's why links that share copyrighted stuff are taken down. What I meant was that other people can't know what OP is downloading, whether it's copyrighted or not. Thus dowloading movies from MEGA is harmless for OP.</p>

        <p>As far as I know downloading from MEGA is not a problem at all. Sharing something however causes your links to get taken down but I doubt anything more would happen.</p>

        <p>You can use JDownloader 2 instead of of IDM. It's free and works exactly e same way. I my experience its even a little faster.</p>
