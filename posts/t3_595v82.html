        <p>Never seen Filthy Rich and Catflap so thanks for this! I love Bottom and the Young Ones so I'm sure I'll enjoy.
Edit: Just saw you say Rebecca Front is in "The Spa," which I'd never heard of, so that's to the front of the queue. She's fantastic. Loved her since "If I Ruled the World."</p>
<p>Do you have House of Fools by any chance?</p>

        <p>Never thought I'd see Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap on the net! It's weird how it's so similar to Young Ones in type of humour and cast but it's miles away in quality. Call Tarby!</p>

<p>Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap: Richie (Rik Mayall) is a former actor who has only one ambition - to be famous. He believes that everyone knows who he is and often has a paranoid feeling that people are out to get him. He lives with his minder Edward (Ade Edmondson), a drunk. His agent Ralph Filthy (Nigel Planner) is not very good at his job and apart from being an agent, he is involved in some rather shady businesses. This series follows Richie's pathetic attempts to reach stardom. He stops at nothing to reach his goal, he even contemplates killing his own father. Fourth wall breaking happens very often. Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry make an appearance in one episode, as well as young Chris Barrie. This is the series that lives between The Young Ones and Bottom, and is similar in style.</p>
<p>Life's Too Short: Warwick Davis runs a small person talent agency and playing a twisted version of himself, he's quite conceited, arrogant and manipulative. He is doing this documentary to improve his career as he is going through a messy divorce and needs the money. Warwick bugs Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant about whether they have any work, much to their annoyance.</p>
<p>The Spa: The Spa follows the daily running of a health club where a run in with the staff can be deadly. The spa is run by bossy manageress Alison Crabbe, who is confident she can turn the spa into a successful business, despite a series of unfortunate accidents and terrible customer service. Alison is joined by an eccentric and inept group of employees who find themselves in strange and bizarre situations as a matter of routine. Stars the wonderful Rebecca Front.</p>
