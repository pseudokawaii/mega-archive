    <p><p>Friday, 16 February 2018: <strong>In This Indictment</strong>  </p>
<p>It was Indictment Day again, and this time, special counsel Robert Mueller put the names of 13 Russians and three Russian companies on his list, who were involved in election meddling | The indictment tells us a lot more about how the Russians penetrated and influenced American politics, including interacting with unwitting Trump associates, or hiring actors to pose as Hillary in a prison uniform (did someone say paid protesters?) | Trump, finally admitting Russian meddling for the first time, thinks he is being vindicated again, after it became clear that the Russian meddling started in 2014, when he wasn't running for office yet | Besides Trump, the Russians also supported Presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein, making both ask themselves why they were targeted this way | A new name appears on the Mueller flip list: Richard Pinedo, who was charged with identity fraud in the Russia investigation, and is now cooperating with Mueller | The gun reform discussion changes after the Florida High School shooting, as the voices of the survivors get louder | FBI apparently got a tip about the shooter in January, but didn't follow up on it  </p>
