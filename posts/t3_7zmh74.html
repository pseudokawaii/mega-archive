    <strong>[DOCUMENTARY] Creating Freedom: The Lottery of Birth by Raoul Martinez 2013 1080p WEBRip DD2.0 x264 -monkee (3.83GB) + epub</strong>
    <p><blockquote>
<p>Free markets, free elections, free media, free thought, free speech, free will--the language of freedom pervades our lives, framing the most urgent issues of our time and the deepest questions about who we are and who we want to be. It is a foundational concept at the heart of our civilization, but it has long been distorted to justify its opposite: soaring inequality, the erosion of democracy, an irrational criminal justice system, and a dehumanizing foreign policy. Raoul Martinez argues that the more we understand the limits on our freedom, the better placed we are to transcend them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you shape the world or does the world shape you? We do not choose to exist or the environment in which we grow up. Our starting point in life is one of passive reliance on forces over which we have no control. Drawing on leading thinkers from around the world, THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH shows that from birth onwards our minds are a battleground of competing forces — familial, educational, cultural, and professional — and that the outcome of this battle not only determines who we become, but the society that we create.</p>

—Stephen Fry—</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Provocative, powerful and important, Creating Freedom is a rigorous exploration of what's gone wrong with our society and how to make it right. A book for our time, this radical manifesto exposes the myths at the heart of our system and shows what the ideal of freedom truly demands from us, individually and collectively."
—Susan Sarandon—</p>
