    <strong>[DOCUMENTARY] Asma al-Assad [720p WEBRip | x264 | AAC] [651MB]</strong>
    <p><p>(2017 Deutsche Welle DocFilms)  </p>
<p><strong>Asma al-Assad, the First Lady of Syria, grew up in London and had a promising career. Later, as wife of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, she became a beacon of hope for Syria. Today, hope is long gone and she is regarded as the dictator’s accomplice.</strong>  </p>
<p>The former ambassador of the European Union to Syria, Frank Hesske, still gets a sparkle in his eyes when he talks about Asma al-Assad, the beautiful First Lady of Syria. She was ‘a darling’, and comparable to Princess Diana - and not just because of her British roots: ‘We diplomats,’ the former ambassador now reveals with surprising honesty, ‘let ourselves be seduced’. Many of the diplomats, politicians and journalists from the West who met the presidential couple during the 11 years after Assad took power and before the civil war broke out shared that fate: they let themselves be duped. Torture, arrests and threats were unleashed on all those who got in the way of the regime - just as under Assad’s father. There’s the famous opposition activist Riad Seif, whose daughter talks about the regime’s humiliations and the constant fear that her family could be taken by the secret police and her father killed. While the country remains as dark as ever, this film looks at Asma al-Assad’s international role as the face of the dictatorship, the woman from London who for a long time managed to make the Assads socially acceptable.  </p>

        <p>I think people forget that real syrian dictator died back in 2000.   Hafez Assad hasn't been in power for decades.  His milquetoast son could hardly be called a dictator. More Deutsche Welle propaganda unfortunately.</p>
