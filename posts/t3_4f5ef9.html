    <strong>[REQUEST]: "Nowhere Boys" (2013 - 2014): 26 Episodes + 1 Movie: "Nowhere Boys: The Book of Shadows" (2016)</strong>
    <p><p>Looking for all 26 episodes of <strong>Nowhere Boys</strong> (2013 - 2014).  Here is what the series is about:</p>
<p><em>Set in the fictional suburb of Bremin, the series follows four mismatched year ten students — Felix Ferne, the Goth (Dougie Baldwin), Andrew "Andy" Lau, the Nerd (Joel Lok), Sam Conte, the Golden Child (Rahart Adams) and Jake Riles, the Jock (Matt Testro) — who would never be friends. The boys are unwillingly grouped together during a school orienteering excursion in the forest and get lost. After they spend a terrifying night in the forest, they return to Bremin and discover that they have come back to a parallel world where they were never born. Nobody, including their family and friends recognise who they are, and all public records of them have vanished.</em></p>
<p>As well as <strong>Nowhere Boys: The Book of Shadows</strong> (2016).  Here is what it is about:</p>
<p><em>Picking up one year after the boys crossed dimensions, they discover magic and battle the restoring demon. Having grown apart, they are all brought back together again when Felix discovers the magically sealed Book of Shadows that unwittingly unleashes a very powerful force of chaos. The boys are then reluctantly drawn into a battle that threatens both their world and their loved ones.</em></p></p>
