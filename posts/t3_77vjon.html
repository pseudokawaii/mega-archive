    <strong>[Meta] Choosing Opus as an audio codec</strong>
    <p><p>Paging /u/ecchh</p>
<p>Technical merits aside, Opus audio is a poor choice for a soundtrack: no major hardware player supports Opus and those of us who watch movies on TV have to transcode the audio track to a mainstream format (AAC, mp3, etc).</p>
<p>While audiophiles could argue that, at identical bit rates, the psycho-acoustics of Opus are better than, say, mp3, with <strong>movies</strong> (i.e. not extremely-high quality sound tracks, played through specialized amps and high-end speakers) using Opus instead of a mainstream codec is a very questionable choice.</p>
<p>The above observations notwhitstanding, thank your for posting so many good movies!</p></p>

        <p>I use Opus as my audio codec because I really don't like the results that AAC gives me at identical bitrates to Opus. Maybe it's because I'm using audiophile equipment to listen to my movies, but I can always hear an annoying hiss in 5.1 AAC audio @384k during speech whereas none of that is present in the Opus track. I've also found Opus compresses better, allowing the audio to only take up ~200MB instead of several hundred, while still retaining clarity.</p>
<p>I started encoding these videos for my own personal use since I couldn't find x265 versions of specific films I wanted. I wasn't worried about compatibility because I knew that it would work with the setup I have. While I was doing the work of encoding these movies anyway, though, I figured I would upload them here as well in case other people wanted them.</p>
<p>Perhaps that explains my choice a little more.</p>

        <p>While I tend to agree with you about the merits of using AAC as opposed to Opus, this is one of those things I say is up to the uploaders.  My feeling is you get what you get, if someone is willing to take requests for specific formats you want terrific, if you have a hardware compatibility issue worst case you can convert the audio to another format for yourself.  Yes this results in a slight drop in quality but I will again refer to "Beggars can't be Choosers".</p>

<p>You are absolutely right - hence, my thanks to the original poster.</p>
<p>I just wanted to let the poster(s) know that "Works for me just fine" may not be applicable to many - which undermines his very laudable intent of sharing something with other people; this could simply be avoided with a couple of clicks, and choosing a different, mainstream codec.</p>

<p>Sure bout dat?
Kodi plays Opus.. Kodi is your god.
If your hardware or software can't play Opus you need to get out of the 1990's.</p>

        <p>I think you misunderstood. Let me rephrase it:</p>
<p>-for normal, watching-at-home, movies, through <strong>normal</strong> speakers/sound systems, going over the top with encoding parameters gives you nothing but a waste of space. Normal TVs and/or sound systems simply don't have the tech specs that would allow them to take advantage of losless and beyond;</p>
<p>-even if you had a super-specialized, extremely expensive sound system, it's very unlikely that the movie's sound track has the acoustic range that would make a difference to a listener;</p>
<p>-even if your movie is one of those very, very rare movies with such a sound track, your typical listener won't hear much of a difference (you need to be one of the winners of the genetic lottery AND have a film with an OST that's more that speech, explosions and typical sound effects);</p>
<p>-as I was saying, it was a problem with a certain codec being supported by mainstream, VERY MODERN, <strong>hardware</strong> players.</p>
<p>Sorry, but it had nothing to do with Kodi - or any other <strong>software</strong> player.</p>

        <p>I like AC3 for 5.1 Audio since my Roku can direct play AC3 5.1
For 2 CH audio AAC is good as well. I am not sure about Opus but i do see it as default option in Staxrip, so might be something popular.</p>

        <p>As I was saying, the problem with Opus is its lack of support in <strong>hardware</strong> players (Roku, etc). Those who watch movies on their laptops (via VLC or other software) don't have this problem. Same for those who connect/stream from their laptops to their TVs. The issue affecs those who use their TVs to decode natively or their external hardware players.</p>

        <p>I am using Plex, so it transcodes the audio as needed. There is not much CPU usage for Audio transcode.</p>
