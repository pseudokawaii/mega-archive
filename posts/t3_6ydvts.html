    <strong>[META] Thinking about switching your library to HEVC/H.265? AV1 and why you should consider waiting (x-post from /r/PleX)</strong>
    <p><p>I just want to start and say that this is written by /u/pcjonathan. I am not sure how to crosspost a text post so if this breaks any rules, I fully apologize. This is a fantastic post about why you don't have to jump head first into x265 and I wanted to share with all of you.</p>
<h1>Some background</h1>
<p>AVC/H.264 is getting kind of old now and so along comes its its successor, HEVC/H.265, boasting a 30-50% improvement over AVC. It's relatively successful, but hardware is slow to support it and it's only just really coming into fruition this past year or two, despite being released in 2013.</p>
<p>Why? Mainly, money. While non-commercial use cases don't need to pay, commercial ones do. We're mainly talking hardware support as well as content distribution. HEVC is <em>vastly</em> more expensive and complicated than AVC. Instead of 1 patent pool (a bunch of patents by various companies joined together), there are 3, as well as a separate company dealing with their own directly. This means that the costs are waaaay higher, which was enough to get the attention of multiple major companies. And thus, the Alliance of Open Media was born and the work on a new codec, AOMedia Video 1, began. It is the sucessor of Google's VP9 (mostly used by YouTube) with concepts from Mozilla's Daala and Cisco's Thor added.</p>
<h1>Who is involved, expected release and adoption</h1>
<p>AV1 is due for a bitstream freeze at the end of the year, although with a target of 20% improvement over HEVC at a certain area of additional encode time, this could end up being earlier or later. While we have no idea how the release groups will react (probably in the same way as to HEVC, i.e. waiting a bit for it to be optimised for faster/higher quality encodes), we can be fairly sure that adoption elsewhere will be relatively rapid.</p>
<p>Due to Google, Mozilla and Microsoft's involvement, browser support can be expected within weeks, days, maybe even hours (Firefox <em>already</em> has it as a build option). General software support in applications is also expected soon after due to involvement from Microsoft (for Windows), VideoLAN (for VLC) and its open-source nature (for basically everything from OpenPHT to PMP (via MPV) to FFMPEG to whatever else. Hell, early test versions are already in a GUI encoder or two). Due to AMD, ARM, Intel and NVIDIA's involment, hardware support is expected wihtin 1-2 years and an increased hardware quality due to their involvement in the development process. Due to Amazon, BBC R&amp;D, Google, Hulu and Netflix's involvement, it is expected to be used by major content distributors. Both YouTube and Netflix have stated that they intend to implement it enmass within months.</p>
<p>My point is that this is no flash in the pan and has every chance of being a very strong contender.</p>
<h1>What does this mean for us?</h1>
<p>While the improvement isn't much, it will have an improvement of at least 20% over HEVC (so around 45-60% over AVC).</p>
<p>But the main difference would be browser support and thus increased support all round, especially for those who share their libraries where most people will use Plex Web. Even though Edge and Safari have limited HEVC support (Edge depends on hardware decoding, Safari will have it on the latest OS soon, so probably around 1-5% at most will have support), Chrome and Firefox don't and almost definitely will not add HEVC support (AVC was mostly down to Cisco but they're part of AOM so that probably won't happen again). They will, however, add AV1 support, (Around 75% of the market) which means files won't always need to be transcoded, greatly reducing CPU usage and allowing it to be used on more servers.</p>
<p>Of course, this depends on Plex adding the feature, which could take a few months (For example, Chrome added FLAC in mid-Jan and Firefox added it August 2016. Plex added it as a supported direct-play codec in mid-April.)</p>
<h1>Why Post?</h1>
<p>While I'm sure those of you already in the HEVC ecosystem (especially Apple users) are probably going to continue with it, I would highly suggest anyone thinking about spending the time and effort redownloading/encoding HEVC content or buying HEVC equipment (like an NVIDIA SHIELD or Smart TV) to hold off for a bit to see what transpires. Even if AV1 goes nowhere and ends up dead, it would be good to be sure.</p>
<h1>Afterthoughts</h1>
<p>Afterthought #1: HEVC gives savings of around 30-50%. Don't go into it expecting a 500mb file to match that of a 2.5gb file, which is something I've seen a fair number of people here doing.</p>
<p>Afterthought #2: x264 and x265 are open-source encoders to AVC and HEVC, not codecs of their own right. Also something I've seen people here confused about.</p>
<p>Afterthought #3: If you're re-encoding your library in order to save disk space, consider whether the effort and the electricity cost is worth it (against, say, getting another HDD). Also consider the fact that tools like Handbrake don't change their CRF or bitrate settings automatically according to the content and so you could be artificially inflating the file size or losing much more quality than you bargained for.</p>
<p>Afterthought #4: Do a fresh encode from the original source, not encoding the pre-existing encode. Encoding an encode results in shitter quality. </p></p>

        <p>I'm sticking with H264 for the time being. I've already spent years replacing all my movies SD with 1080p versions - I can't be bothered doing that again just to save some space. HDDs are cheap and my download speeds are around 150mb and uncapped so file size isn't too much of an issue. </p>
<p>I'm also not going to change until more stuff is compatible. I share my library with my household, as well as family remotely, so it just makes sense to stick with a format that everyone can use. And no - I'm not going to build a Raspberry Pi, or a NUC or whatever - I mean stuff that normal consumers buy from PC World and can stick straight into their TV. </p>

<p>Agree. But with companies like Google, Hulu, Amazon and Netflix (Intel, ARM, NVIDIA, ...) developing the codec and already having declared their intention to use it on a massive scale, you can expect a way way waaaaaaay higher adaption rate and guranteed support for as long as anything can be expected.</p>

        <p>Interesting but a few notes, some more important than others:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>HEVC file compression is actually in the range of 40%-60% over AVC with a theoretical (although almost certainly unachievable on most files) limit of 75% compression without quality loss, this is because HEVC can identify groups of static pixels which do not need to be stored in subsequent frames in blocks 4x larger than AVC (64x64 vs 16x16 - see pic: https://icdn7.digitaltrends.com/image/hevcslide1-640x640.png
)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technically HEVC, AVC, x264, and x265 are all <em>decoding</em> standards, not encoders or encoding algorithms.  The codec actually defines who a file should be read back, not written, which is why there is so much variability between encoders: they can use any process they want to create the file as long as the result conforms to the expected standard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wouldn't reccomend waiting based off the possiblity that a future codec might surpass the one you are using now.  Everyone is always trying to build a better mousetrap and there is always new technology on the horizon, I generally don't recommend waiting on that since it takes years to adopt a standard and by the point what you're looking at becomes widely used someone will be developing the next version.</p>
</li>

        <p>HEVC ALL THE WAY. It's the same with x264 in the beginning. Everyone was upset when scene made the switch from avi to x264 mkv/mp4. Just give it some time for manufacturers to catch up. Also AV1 is now being developed it not even a true competitor of hevc because it is less efficient atm. PEOPLE JUST GOOGLE AND READ and make your own opinions.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: my laptop from 2012 (Lenovo ideapad Z570) still works fine and plays x265 smoothly.</p>
<p>Also, it's generally unheard of that laptops or computers last more than 6-7 years without any upgrade. Deal with it.
Comparing it with a car is like comparing apples and oranges. Your point is still invalid since we're talking about future scope. </p>

<p>To be fair, my media center is built with parts that are over a decade old and it can transcode and play x265 just fine, so this might be a case of "get with the times", considering you can buy a $30-$40 self-contained Android/Linux box that could likely handle it just fine.</p>

        <p>You missed a major point of my argument. Streaming is a niche in which vp9 which was developed for streaming is already very strong with the companies you named. So that niche probably will see wide range adoption however for a personal stored collection you don't need a specialized streaming codec and x264 has established dominance here with x265 building on a big user base. I don't see any new codec breaking in there anytime soon or in any useful way.</p>

        <p>How is HEVC for people with a big collection? In really high quality areas the only thing HEVC is used for is the UHD Remuxes. Everything else is (good quality) still H264, because HEVC still sucks at many things.</p>
<p>And when AV1 becomes a standard for the content providers mentioned above remuxes/WEB-DLs will be available having the same (or better) quality as the H264 sources.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm pretty sure with the players involved they will just push AV1 with a marketforce (and share) that HEVC has no chance against. We will end up with H264 as good old standard and AV1 as the future. HEVC will slowly die (I predict 3-5 yrs till its rarely used) and that's it.</p>

        <p>I've read about the imminent freeze of the AV1 bit-stream a handful of times over the last 18 months already and it's still fluid. I'm sure they'll get there eventually, but who knows if the most recent expected deadline will be hit or not.</p>
<p>Even after it's finalised it's going to take years for a notable percentage of peoples' TVs and hardware to be able to decode this format natively; I don't see ppl rushing out to drop hundreds of dollars on a new TV for such a feature.</p>
<p>And IF it delivers its promises with regards to quality vs h265, it's an incremental baby step, not like the great strides from mpeg2 to mpeg4-advanced to h264 to h265.</p>
<p>If they push Opus for the audio codec, that'll save some space too. But even when this possibly-slightly-better-than-h265 standard is finally rubber stamped, there's still going to be the usual circle of no-one encodes in it because nothing supports it, and no one will support it (in hardware) until there is content for it.</p>
<p>I expect it will get some traction eventually, but it's really not a panacea for video encoding, and h265's foothold gets stronger every day. it might cost more for the patents, but really, how much does it add to the average $700 TV? Not a great deal.</p>
<p>x265 (probably the best h265 encoder?) gets better with every release, and more and more devices are compatible with it because there's so much growing content for it. It ain't going anywhere soon.</p>

<li>H264 for a while I suppose. (Apple user here) if I'm not watching mobile or blu-ray then I'm downloading H264/mp4 from links in this sub to drop on a USB and play on my PS4 (dumb tv from 2010), however I don't make a fuss if there's an abundance of HEVC (especially if its &lt;4GB) as I'll just HDMI my cheap Win10 Laptop to my tv &amp; watch that way. </li>
<li>This is the first I've heard of AV1 and I highly doubt PS4 or any smart TV I get in the near future might support it. Before I had my PS4 &amp; spare laptop I had could only watch stuff on my PS3 so I had to hunt for quality H264 releases as most folks just shared mkv's (I realize mkv's can contain H264 but even that didn't fly on PS3), so I was pleasantly surprised to find the abundance of H264 on this sub as it's just more convenient, and I don't think I'll be allocating and space to a format less proven than mkv.</li>

        <p>so hold off on any unneeded hardware purchase till AV1 gets at least hardware decoding? x265 hardware encoding decoding only just arrived on intel with 7th gen cpus, whats your guesstimate to when it'll arrive with intel provided AV1 is officially released this December? </p>

        <p>I think 6th gen CPUs already had HEVC hardware decode. 7th gen just extended it to 10-bit HEVC and VP9 hardware decode. </p>
<p>Same with Nvidia. HEVC hardware decode was available in Maxwell(950 and 960) and got strengthened with Pascal. </p>

        <p>changing the bitrate basically, and using slower more complex (but more space saving calculations during encoding) a 5gb file will have way more data (literally bits) compared to something thats only 1.5gb. i.e. pixels of colors that are similar in an area may get written of as the same color to save space etc </p>

        <p>So you will always lose quality then. Did expect that, but was hoping for a more efficient algorithm that keeps quality with lower file size, aka smarter compression. Another point obviously is that you don't always have to see the difference in quality, like playing a 10bit color depth video on an 8bit screen is pointless </p>

<p>no it isn't. 10 bit is always better than 8 bit due to a more efficient and more accurate encoding. That is less errors in color calculations which leads to a more accurate representation of the source material. You don't have 10 bit of color if your source only has 8 bit but you have less color bending. tldr 10 bit is always better than 8 bit. </p>

        <p>It literally says in that article you posted that it's a hardware issue on your end and Kodi's supported HEVC for multiple versions (software wise). So, you should probably learn how to read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>H.265/HEVC Support in Kodi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kodi v14 introduced software decoding</strong> support for HEVC. <strong>Kodi v15 introduced limited hardware decoding support for some devices</strong>, such as a few Android-based video decoders, for Linux on Amlogic SoCs and for Windows via DXVA. <strong>Kodi v16 further improved</strong> hardware decoding on Android and Windows and introduced it via VAAPI and VDPAU API on linux. Most HTPCs do not have hardware decoding support for HEVC, so they will need a fairly powerful desktop class CPU in order to playback HEVC videos.</p>
<p>So, the reasons for Kodi H.265/HEVC playback issues will be various.When you can’t play H.265/HEVC files on Kodi, you can try the mothods below.</p>
