    <strong>[TV] Spellbinder (Season 1) [4.41GB]</strong>
    <p><p>Spellbinder is a fantasy teen drama/science fiction television series, produced by Film Australia and Telewizja Polska in association with the Australian Children's Television Foundation.</p>
<p>The series is a 1995 serial of 26 episodes, co-produced between Australia and Poland. It was also novelised by the creators, Mark Shirrefs and John Thomson.</p>
<p>The shots were taken both in Australia which represented the "modern" world (Sydney, Blue Mountains) and in Poland where most pictures that featured the parallel world were shot (Kraków-Częstochowa Upland, Ogrodzieniec, Zawiercie, Czocha Castle). Czocha Castle was used as the Spellbinder's castle and the ruins of Ogrodzieniec Castle were used as the ruins of the Old Spellbinder's castle.</p>
<p>Spellbinder was followed by, Spellbinder: Land of the Dragon Lord, in which Heather Mitchell and Rafal Zwierz reprise their roles as Ashka and Gryvon respectively.</p>
