<p>This movie also goes by the title of Ransom in Britain. It is a tense drama with Ian McShane and Sean Connery (need I say more!!???). Connery is the head of a security force sent in to negotiate with terrorist holding an ambassador and his servants. The terrorist demand transport to the airport, where they learn an aeroplane has been hijacked and is awaiting the arrival of the terrorists and their hostages. Connery is determined to stop them at all costs. It is a taught game of move-counter move, with nearly everyone involved running their own game within a game, and Connery can trust no one. McShane is very believable at the head of the hijacking team, that has more than one mask he is wearing.</p></p>
