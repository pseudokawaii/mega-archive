    <strong>[GAME] Descent 1 and 2 game files for DXX-Rebirth (removed from Steam and GOG) [147.47 MB]</strong>
    <p><p>Decode this to get the link:</p>
<p>aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWdhLm56LyMhMjBwQmxTYlQhVEhLdEViZFJXWkViX2hwWlhWbU90c1NtSWpTdl9rZGVydXNJYkVfV2MxWQ==</p>
<p>Included are all the necessary files for Descent 1 and 2 to run with <a href="http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/">DXX-Rebirth</a>.</p>
<p>Also check out <a href="http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/addons/">DXX-Rebith's Addons page</a> for additional game enhancements. They can be downloaded freely from that site, so I won't waste your download quote by uploading them.</p>
<p>DXX-Rebirth runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It can works on ARM based Linux machines, most notably the Raspberry Pi. Indeed, Retropie comes with the option to install DXX-Rebirth.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed from the title, Descent 1 and 2 have been removed from Steam and GOG, as has Descent 3. I do not promote piracy of PC games that are still available for sale. Since this is not the case, I'm uploading this. This link WILL be taken down if Descent 1 and 2 start being sold on Steam and/or GOG again. If.</p>
<p>People who want to play Descent 1 + 2 without having to mess with DXX-Rebirth will be pleased to hear that my next upload will be the GOG installers for Descent 1, 2, 3, and all "GOG Goodies" provided for those games.</p>
<p>However, it is my opinion that it is better to play these games with DXX-Rebirth instead of with the default GOG installation. I have created an upload with only the files needed for DXX-Rebirth to work for people who just want those files, as well as for people who haven't paid for a premium version of Mega yet.</p></p>

<p>As for this? This is just a manifestation of my inner "Crusading Archivist".</p>

        <p>Oh, hey! Look:
https://archive.org/details/msdos_Descent_Anniversary_Edition_1996</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1996, Descent: Anniversary Edition was released on the one-year anniversary of the original game's debut. The Anniversary Edition featured Descent, the Levels Of The World add-on, and several additional levels created by Parallax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://archive.org/details/msdos_Descent_II_Vertigo_Series_1996</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On November 15, 1996 came Descent II: Vertigo Series, an add-on for Descent II. It contains 22 new levels, two new multiplayer game types, new music, enemies, boss AI and Descent Mission Builder 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both links point to zip archives with already unpacked DOSBOX-friendly install directories, plus a disk image. 
The D2 archive has both the D2 disk as well as the Vertigo Series add-on disk. Both are stored as bin/cue images, so Windows users may need something to mount it -- I personally use <a href="http://wincdemu.sysprogs.org/portable/">WinCDEmu</a>.</p>
<p>Also note, these bin/cue disk images have audio track designations. If you're so inclined, you should be able to listen to game tracks if you burned the images to a CD. I did manage to rip the audio from these disks with <em><a href="http://i.imgur.com/xFszhje.png">modest</a></em> success.</p>
<p>The D1 image is an iso and can be extracted from by using 7zip, or mounted directly.</p>
<p>Certainly use ajshell1's upload for a clean and easy installation into DXX-Rebirth, but keep these links handy for the mission packs and historical novelty.</p>

        <p>Use rebirth as suggested, higher resolutions and no crazy head bob. I'm guessing GoG probably throttled the games to help solve the issue, but seriously, just use the updated engine. It plays great and runs directly under windows instead of in a DOS emulator so you can use modern controls and everything. Or you can dig up GX-Edit and disable bob. It's a VB 3.0 app, so likely doesn't work in modern windows, but I could dig up the source if you want to port it to a technology that's not a couple decades old. :p</p>

        <p>All 3 Descent games the ship has a gentle up and down movement when moving or idle . It was very subtle on my 586 and Pentium 1 computer which these games were designed for.</p>
<p>When I try installing any of the 3 original version games from their CD's on a new computer and that subtle up and down movement happens 100's times a second and liable to give you a seizure. </p>
<p>Head bob is not really the correct term, but it the closest term I could come up with. If you had seen it then you would understand. Obviously you have an updated version installed and not the original.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just got done testing. There is SOME bobbing up and down, but it's only happens like once a second. Not the 100's of times you mention.</p>

        <p>The ship bobs, even when standing still, to represent flying. In the original engine, it's tied to framerate, so on modern machines where you're getting hundreds of FPS, the ship can literally bounce itself to death slamming into the ceiling and floor.</p>
