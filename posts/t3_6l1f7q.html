    <strong>[GAME] Type-Moon visual novel pack: Tsukihime, Tsukihime Plus-Disc, Kagetsu Tohya, Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Hollow Ataraxia (English patched) (Adult content) [5.22 GB]</strong>
    <p><p>WARNING: Four out of five of these games contain explicit descriptions of sex scenes, as well as graphic depictions of violence. If you don't want to experience this sort of thing, don't download these games.</p>
<p>Decode this from base 64 to get the links (Please use copy-paste. Don't kill yourself)</p>

<p>EDIT: IMPORTANT! THE VERSION OF FATE/STAY NIGHT I UPLOADED IS NOT THE DEFINITIVE VERSION OF THE GAME!</p>
<p>I will be uploading the "Definitive version" sometime tomorrow, or maybe tonight if you are REALLY lucky.</p>
<p>Replace the "xxxx" in the links with "mega".</p>
<p>You'll get five mega links when you decode that. Each link contains a different game. They <em>should</em> be listed in the same order as they are listed in the title.</p>
<p>As for the sex scenes in this game, you can safely skip them. They're pretty bad. I'm not the only one with this opinion. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/3jn9t2/i_made_another_tier_listbased_on_most_memorable_h/cuqqha4/">This ranking of H-Scenes in visual novels</a> posted in /r/visualnovels gives Tsukihime's and Fate/Stay Night's H-Scenes an "E" ranking. Also, Fate/Stay Night records your play time, and I put about ~20 hours into the game before I saw the first H-Scene. If you are in this for the porn, this is NOT the visual novel for you.</p>
<p>I've played these games before, so here is my documentation of the save data in these games:</p>
<p>Tsukihime: I renamed the file that contains the save data from "gloval.sav" to "gloval.bak". This should mean that you'll get a fresh start when you play it. You won't go straight to a main menu when you start. This is normal. You can safely delete global.bak if you want. IIRC it contains save data with all routes non-bad ends completed.</p>
<p>Kagetsu Tohya: See above. It runs on the same engine, so I gave the same save file the same treatment. I haven't FULLY completed this one though.</p>
<p>Tsukihime Plus-Disc: In the directory "savedata", there are three files: data999.ksd, datasc.ksd, and datasu.ksd. Delete them if you want. This game is so short that I doubt you'll need to save unless you get interrupted.</p>
<p>Fate/Stay Night: Delete all the files in the "savedata" directory. This should reset the save data back to normal. You should see a message from the creators of the patch if you do this properly, telling you not to distribute patched copies of the game (which I am willfully disobeying). My existing save data places me partway through the "Fate" route, with none of the other two routes completed.</p>
<p>Fate/Hollow Ataraxia: No save data, as I won't play this game until I complete Fate/Stay Night. Just click FateFD.exe to play. A file named "config.ksc" will be created the first time you start the game. This file controls where the save data for this game goes. This defaults to a directory inside the "Fate Hollow Ataraxia" directory named "FateHA_Savedata". If you decide that you want to change where this game is installed, you will have to edit that file with a text editor to prevent it from saving in the previous location.</p>
<p>Enjoy! If there is demand, I'll upload the fan-translated games in the "Melty Blood" series (a fighting game spinoff series), as well as "Battle Moon Wars", which is a fan-game in the style of Super Robot Wars. I'll also upload Mahoutsukai no Yoru once that gets a 100% English patch.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you so much, I just started watching Fate and now I want to play the games. Also, do you know what order to play or watch Fate and is this the Realta Nua version?</p>

        <p>This does NOT contain Realta Nua content. The timestamps for the files in the Fate/Stay Night folder are all dated 11/11/2013. The Realta Nua patch wasn't released until 2014.</p>
<p>I've already located a version of the game with Realta Nua content. I'm downloading it as we speak.</p>
<p>As for order, I'm not quite sure what you mean.</p>
<p>I'd recommend abandoning the Fate/Stay Night anime for now and concentrating on the visual novel.</p>
<p>Start with the "Prologue" route, then move on to the "Fate" route, then the "Unlimited Blade Works" route, then the "Heaven's Feel" route.</p>
<p>Fate/Hollow Ataraxia is a "bonus" game and shouldn't be played until you are done with the main game.</p>
<p>The only other part of the series I'm familiar with is Fate/Zero, which is a prequel to Fate/Stay Night. I've been told that you should read (it was originally a novel series) it after Fate/Stay Night.</p>
<p>Fate/Extra is a spin-off with no relation to the plot of the original game and can be played any time (I think). It has an official English release.</p>
<p>Fate/Extra CCC is the sequel to Fate/Extra. It does NOT have an official English release, and the Fan-translation for it apparently stalled a few months ago.</p>
<p>Fate/Unlimited Codes is a subpar fighting game spin-off  where you are forced to decide between the English PSP version which runs below 30 FPS or the PS2 version with a good framerate but is entirely in Japanese. Buy Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code on Steam if you want to play a good Type-Moon fighting game.</p>
<p>I don't know anything about the anime series or any of the other games.</p>

        <p>Hey, just tried to download the Tsukihime VN and the  thing wont download.  Mega says that its initializing, but after a short bit, it says that it failed.  Really want to play through it since Ive heard more than enough about it to make me want to get it and read through it all.  If this is something that can be fixed through here or PM, then let me know.  Thanks in advance for the links!</p>
