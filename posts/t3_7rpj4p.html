<p>He was the one veteran, they couldn't ignore! Screen icon Tommy Lee Jones (Blown Away) stars in this explosive thriller about a Vietnam vet's drastic steps to make his country sit up and take notice. The war in Asia is over, but one disillusioned, disappointed ex-soldier decides to declare his own war bringing attention to the unfair and unjust treatment of Vietnam veterans in America. An expert in jungle warfare and guerilla tactics, the ex-soldier uses his lethal knowledge to "take" New York City's Central Park. Even Manhattan's street-wise cops, under the command of sympathetic Frank Eubanks (Yaphet Kotto, Report to the Commissioner), are no match for the skilled commando who within hours, proclaim, The Park is Mine. And in the blazing confrontation that follows, the Vietnam War just might be fought all over again right here at home. Helen Shaver (The Believers) and Lawrence Dane (Scanners) co-star this suspense-filled action film, featuring atmospheric and haunting musical score by Tangerine Dream (The Keep, Thief, Miracle Mile).</p></p>
