<p>Chevy Chase stars as Max Fielder, a high-strung airtraffic controller whose bad day is about to get much worse: His girlfriend (Patti D'Arbanville) has moved out, his ex-wife is in love with his old friend, and a splashing truck full of toxic waste has made him glow a very odd green. But when Max discovers that this radioactive sludge has given him the power of telekinesis, he sets his mind -- and various other flying objects -- to winning back his girlfriend and getting some wildly outrageous revenge. Will a pompous self-help guru (Dabney Coleman) make Max lose control? Can a sassy voodoo priestess (Nell Carter) exorcise Max's demons? It takes a man who can make the earth move to take on these and more MODERN PROBLEMS! Mary Kay Place (SWEET HOME ALABAMA) and Brian Doyle-Murray (CADDYSHACK) costar in this hilarious hit from the co-writer/director of the cult comedy classic THE GROOVE TUBE.</p></p>
