<p>Jeremy and Ralph are best friends - but while Ralph apparently has no trouble asking out women, Jeremy is shy around the fairer gender, despite the fact that the beautiful cheerleader Candy has the hots for him. But Jeremy is strangely drawn to Darla Blake - a baritone sax player in the band and not the type of girl that usually leads to the sorts of dreams that Jeremy has been having about her.</p>
<p>Things start to get strange when Jeremy's dream about Darla is interrupted by a strange woman. Even weirder, the next day when out delivering groceries, Jeremy discovers this strange woman is the new delivery recipient on his grocery route. After her cat has scratched his finger, she first licks, then sucks on his finger and invites him back to her house that night at midnight ... I'm sure you can see where this is going. Needless to say, there is a crazed vampire killer with his bumbling assistant; a vampire "counselor" sent to help Jeremy adjust to his new life (played by the very talented Rene Aberjonois of "Deep Space Nine" fame) and, of course, a bevy of beautiful vampire women. It is also (as far as I can tell) the very first movie in which we see a very young Kathy Bates.</p></p>
