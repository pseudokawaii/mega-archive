<p>The Abyss (1989) Special Edition HDTVrip slowed to run at the original rate, the new time stamp is 2:50:53.743.  This is based off of the file posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/megalinks/comments/6psc2g/movie_the_abyss_special_edition_1989_hdtv_10bit/">here</a> a few months back, thanks /u/Himechi!</p>
<p>The video has been forced from 25fps to 23.976fps (a.k.a. 24000/1001p, speed film runs at), the subtitles stretched by a factor of 1.0427 and the audio was re-sampled for pitch-correction and to account for the time stretch, then filtered to remove high frequency artifacts caused by timecode bleed. This was done in Adobe Audition and the results are very good. I haven't fully watched this file to check it but the process seems to have worked properly, I would appreciate feedback from people if they notice issues with audio quality or sync so that they can be corrected.  FYI, this process did not change the video quality as it only changed the the rate at which the video plays, the individual frames were not altered as the video was not re-encoded.  The bitrate drops very slightly because bitrate is a measure of how much data is processed per second and now fewer frames are processed every second.</p>
<p>A separate AC3 audio track is available for those whose player doesn't support E-AC3, the audio track must be delayed by 521 ms if you want to use it.</p>

        <p>Thanks! I can't believe that they still haven't released this on Blu-Ray. There was supposed to be a 4k Blu-Ray release this year, which doesn't look like it is going to happen. I would love to be able to watch this in 4k! It is one of my favorites.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's ridiculous.  I can go on Amazon right now and order a bluray of <a href="http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Howard-the-Duck-Blu-ray/123623/#Review"><em>Howard The Duck</em></a> with bonus features but it's <em>The Abyss</em> that gets pushed back and back and back.  WT-everloving-F?  The only upside I anticipate from the wait is that we'll get knockout releases in 1080p and 4K.  I'll be thrilled if they port over all the extra content from the Special Edition laserdisc, including the texts.</p>

        <p>It really is ridiculous. So many less deserving, at least in my opinion, films have made it to Blu-Ray and even 4k Blu-Ray. I am going to try to stay positive and be hopeful that we get a 4k release in 2018.</p>
