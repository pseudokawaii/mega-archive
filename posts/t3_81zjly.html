    <strong>[TV] Captain Power And The Soldiers Of The Future 1987 480p DVDrip AAC x264 with extras and OST (6.25GB total)</strong>
    <p><p>http://links.snahp.it/681.power.on  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Power_and_the_Soldiers_of_the_Future"><em>Captain Power And The Soldiers Of The Future</em></a> was a live-action children's tv show made with surprisingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Power_and_the_Soldiers_of_the_Future#Adult_storyline">mature themes and stories.</a>  The show followed a band of human survivors fighting machines in a future devastated by nuclear war.  The story editor was J. Michael Straczynski, who 4 years later would create space opera <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5"><em>Babylon 5</em></a> and hired some former <em>Captain Power</em> staff to work on it.  The show was created by Gary Goddard who directed [<em>Masters of the Universe</em>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe_(film)) and who has since turned out to be <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-goddard-accusers-20171220-story.html">not such a nice guy.</a><br>
Useless trivia: the show co-starred <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n67mI2obO-8">Arnold Schwarzeneggar's old buddy Sven-Ole Thorsen</a> as Lt. Michael 'Tank' Ellis.  They emigrated to the US together.  </p>
<p>What you get:<br>
- all 22 episodes<br>
- 94 minute documentary "Out Of The Ashes" with interviews with cast &amp; crew<br>
- 8 minute featurette describing the planned second season<br>
- 94 minute movie "The Legend Begins" made from a selection of episodes<br>
- the trailer that was first used to sell the show at a toy industry trade fair and to television stations<br>
- rip of the <a href="https://www.soundtrack.net/album/captain-power-and-the-soldiers-of-the-future/">2012 soundtrack release</a> in 320kb/s mp3 (no booklet scans, sadly)  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33lK1e17HYs"><em>Captain Power - Future Force Training video</em></a> that came with the toys.  </p>

        <p>I was amazed at how deep the story was for this series, despite the heavy attempts to market it towards ages 8-12ish (I was 9, and I was enamored by this, despite not being able to catch the whole series)</p>
<p>Huge thanks!</p>

        <p>It was not for children and I think that's why it didn't find the ratings. I had nightmares about being digitized by that pterodactyl thing for weeks. The story was about the last of humanity, so much agony, betrayal and loss.  </p>
<p>What were they thinking showing that stuff with the weekend morning cartoons?</p>

        <p>I think there was a story there that they couldnâ€™t find a way to tell, so once there was a way, they took it? It happens, there are a lot of tales that fail to get the chance they deserved.</p>

        <p>It was like the show had multiple personalities.  It was written for adults but the title didn't help it, the ads for the toys didn't help it and the controversy about showing it to children... that might have helped it a little.  I wonder what we would have gotten if it had been more focused and aimed solely at adults.</p>

<p>Oh, come on.  A few off-camera suicides, people being reduced to a pile of shrieking pixels when they were digitized and the bio-droids shaking with evil digital laughter when they were shot.  Not to mention that last episode.  It wasn't THAT dark.  ;)</p>
