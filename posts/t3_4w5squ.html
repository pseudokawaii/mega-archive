    <strong>[Meta] Does anyone Here actually browse /r/megarquests? (discussion)</strong>
    <p><p>Since the banning of requests on this sub, I havent seen a single request filled on the requests-only sub. I don't think that they all should be filled, or that people are entitled to it, but back before this sub was blown up with requests, it was a really good place to share and recieve good quality files without the dangers of torrenting. I understand that it's grown, and that the sub has become flooded with requests before the embargo, but it doesn't seem like the separate sub approach is working, as of now it's a grab bag of random movies and reuploads (not that I'm ungrateful, what everyone does here is amazing). I just think that something like a weekly or daily requests thread might help get a bit more exposure to what people are searching for, and keep from flooding the top posts. Anyone's thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>Just a suggestion, we could use filter similar to /r/GuessTheMovie to allow people to filter posts by requests, submissions, filled, unfilled, etc. I am not sure how it works, but it might be worth reaching out to their mods?</p>

        <p>I don't think forcing all requests into /r/megarequests is conducive to requests being visible. This is where people are, this is where people come, this is where things get seen. </p>
<p>I would be in favor of a weekly request thread set up by automoderator. We have two sticky slots. If we don't want the sub overwhelmed by request posts, but still want requests to be visible and have the chance to be filled, one of those slots should be used for a request thread. The embargo needs to be amended.</p>

        <p>When did they ban making requests? I've been using this sub since the day it started, and I enjoyed making requests every now and then. It's a shame there's no more requests, maybe they should implement something like you only get one request per week or you have to match the amount of requests with your own submissions.</p>

        <p>Requests aren't banned, they're encouraged. The problem was this sub, which is for links, was becoming mostly requests while the sub that was specifically set up for requests (so that this sub wouldn't be overrun with them) was being totally unused.</p>
<p>So it was a real problem, and the mods asked people to put their requests in the requests sub so that this one isn't swamped by it, but people don't seem to be adjusting to it.</p>

        <p>I see your point and I agree, people may not be requesting there and posting here, but really, they should. It's literally clicking on 2 different tabs in a browser, which everyone does anyway. I know people don't like change, but this is so minor.</p>
<p>If you allow request posts as they were before, they will dominate the sub as they did before. Maybe a weekly request thread is the answer, like some people are suggesting. We used to have a "filter requests" link I think, so maybe categorizing content and letting people filter it via some CSS implementation is the answer. Lots of subreddits have features like this. You could have "request", "content", "meta", and maybe "techsupport" as those seem to be the only categories that really pop up.</p>
<p>The only thing is if you do it that way it's extra work for the mods to set something like that up, and I don't know if submitters or the mods would have to categorize each post. If the mods have to categorize each post that's a real pain for them. If you let submitters do it they may not categorize stuff correctly, which leads to the sub being a mess again. Is it better to implement a system like that, or is it better for people to just click between 2 tabs in their browser? Or is it better to just let requests come back, restore the "filter requests" link, and point it out to people who aren't using it?</p>
<p>The best solution would be for people to just do it the way it's been set up. If people are really going to insist that navigating from one subreddit to another is too much trouble, which everyone on reddit already does anyway, then I just don't know what to say. I guess something else would have to be set up, but I'd hope it doesn't go back to what it was because it was a mess.</p>
