    <strong>[Book] Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance - an inquiry into values</strong>
    <p><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most important and influential books written in the past half-century, Robert M. Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a powerful, moving, and penetrating examination of how we live . . . and a breathtaking meditation on how to live better. Here is the book that transformed a generation: an unforgettable narration of a summer motorcycle trip across America's Northwest, undertaken by a father and his young son. A story of love and fear -- of growth, discovery, and acceptance -- that becomes a profound personal and philosophical odyssey into life's fundamental questions, this uniquely exhilarating modern classic is both touching and transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of existence . . . and the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward.</p>

<p>That's certainly one opinion.  Just be aware that this book is not universally loved.   </p>
<p>In high school, my girlfriend gave me a dog-eared copy of this book, saying "take my copy, it meant a lot to me and I'd like you to read it."  After I finished it, I told her nothing personal, please don't be offended but I just didn't get it and suspect it's just nonsense.  She said "yeah, I know, my uncle gave it to me with those same words and I thought it was rubbish, but you're smart like him so I thought you'd like it as much as he did."</p>
<p>So I passed it on to my next girlfriend the same way.  Almost a year later, she told me she'd finally finished the book, and she just didn't get it.  I confessed its origin, and she punched me in the arm repeatedly and said "that book was the hardest and most unrewarding slog I've gone through!  I only did it for you!"</p>
<p>I met that girl again, just last year, and asked her about that book - she told me she'd passed it on to someone else and doesn't know what became of it.</p>

        <p>I'm in the same boat as you basically. Maybe somebody out there will find value in it, though? lol</p>

        <p>I for one was stoked to see this posted and greatly appreciate it! I read this in high school in 2002 and it meant a great deal to me, so thank you.</p>

        <p>Wait. Isn't this book free online already? I remember downloading a PDF of this book years ago from a website that is very public about it and was not a warez site or anything else related to piracy.</p>
<p>All in all, the book is a grind to read through, but it had to be done...for my high school class years ago. I'm still surprised to hear that classes are still using this book.</p>
