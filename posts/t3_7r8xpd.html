    <strong>[education] Vishen Lakhiani - Becoming Limitless (Mindvalley)</strong>
    <p><p>Link: ( Use base64decode) Cmh0dHBzOi8vbWVnYS5uei8jRiFTcDR5ekRnSSFNWjZJOVVHT21ZUkFLdlNMYzkzWEdRCg==</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This program takes you on a step by step journey, using Vishen Lakhiani’s powerful framework for teaching, into stage 3 consciousness so you too can bend reality and live a limitless life. This framework is so powerful in delivering amazing results that it quickly garnered the highest ever customer rating for a product on Mindvalley Academy with hundreds of raving case studies.</p>
<p>Ideas presented in this program got Vishen one of the biggest book deals of 2016: Code Of The Extraordinary Mind. It put Vishen on stage with the Dalai Lama where he won the best speaker. And these ideas have allowed Vishen, against all odds, to turn $700 into a $100 million dollar business consisting of Afest, Mindvalley Academy, Zenward and more.</p>
<p>It’s a classic case of Bending Reality.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, many people believe that only certain people have a mystical power to shape the world according to their thoughts, to know the right decisions to make and to instantly feel what’s true for them.</p>
<p>Vishen has been investigating the concept of Bending Reality for over 25 years, studying history’s most extraordinary individuals and experimenting with many forms of consciousness expansion. And with his engineer’s mind, he’s believes he’s codified the system to be so simple that anyone can now apply this framework to their life and see results.</p>
<p>This goes way beyond Law of Attraction or the “Thoughts Create Reality” paradigm, which are kindergarten level compared to what you’ll discover in this program.</p></p>
