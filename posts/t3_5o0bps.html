        <p>lol. Oh, gurl. You're judging the creators. You're judging its viewers. You're judging its POSSIBLE viewers. You're judging me. The list goes on.</p>
<p>This was a cartoon that aired on Showtime, a pay cable network, after Queer as Folk. This shit was NOT widespread, you had to really look for it to see it. Propaganda, by definition, is made for the masses to consume. This was made specifically for those of the culture to watch and enjoy. If even THAT'S too much "normalizing" for you, then I don't know what you'd consider acceptable.</p>
<p>I'd recommend taking your head out of your ass before you suggest what I put in mine.</p>

[HUNT] Is "Jeremy" a porn star / does he have more videos? â€“ Speedo / changing room / amateur porn by bbgaybro in gaypornhunters
[â€“]queeroid 1 point 1 year ago 
I don't think he's an actual porn star. I tried finding more of his videos, but I have a feeling he deleted his account on whatever site the videos originated. These are all I could find:
Jeremy, Alberto, and Bobby in the park
Jeremy Jacking in Public
Wilton Manors (which is basically the Fort Lauderdale gayborhood) is mentioned a couple times in the videos and he refers to himself as Justin in one of them. If anyone feels a bit stalker-y, I suppose you can try looking through gay men named Jeremy or Justin living in Fort Lauderdale on Facebook, lol.
I lived in Fort Lauderdale for about 10 years, so I know the area fairly well. I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure that the place with the curved doors in the video is J. Miles and the place where he got sucked off is The Pride Factory. And believe it or not, the "Jeremy Jacking In Public" video looks like it's right outside the Wilton Manors police station. But, honestly, I'm just going on memory, so don't quote me on any of the locations, lol.

<p>your not that smart, and also ask yourself why you are gay... cause you where not certainly born this way. think about it...</p>
<p>and to your recent reply i dont drink..... so this is all sober =) and i dont have any issue with what i said nor how i swear, you swear at me and ill gladly swear at you all night long if i must.</p>
<p>remember you started this, you could have read the comment and just thought to yourself "what a idiot or homopho" and carried on with your day, living your life.. but you've now made me click on your profile to see what you are browsing, ad now you get the last comment, bro dont shit where you eat.... rule one, you get horny go to a porn site, dont mix that crap here.
rule two keep your sexuality private, which it should be, am sure 99% of people dont care what you do behind close doors, if they do then they have a problem and have zero respect for privacy.</p>
<p>if you look at my activity and you'll see three subs i view here, mainly megalink, cause certain items posted here are worth the download.
i dont waste my time anywhere else chitchatting on reddit.com this place is so rubbish, full of little sjw's who think its there mission to change the world, when they should simply look in the mirror.</p>
<p>you want to be gay and suck dick that your business, i dont hate you for it, nor would i want to jail you or even stone you. your a person living in sin like all of us, and GOD will judge you accordingly.</p>
<p>but you come here swear at me, for my the comment i made, that where the problem starts. go fuck yourself first and foremost.
you started this shit..</p>
<p>now enjoy the rest of your week ahead.. </p>

It's you calming the fuck down. IT'S A DUCK. If A MOTHER FUCKING CARTOON DUCK really effects your life in any way, I'm gonna need you to get your own shit together before you judge someone else's.</p>
<p>this cartoon did not affect me in way, cause i didnt waste my time watching, me stating 'wtf is this culture propaganda..' didnt effect anyone else but your butthurt sjw ego... go fuck yourself, your little bitch....</p>
<p>and on a personal tip, i couldnt care less if anyone is gay, sexuality will never be a human right, maybe to you it is, but to me its not, nor will it ever be........... trying to use that as a front for rights is a slippy slope, cause where do you then stop how about a hebephilia, a person who wants to fuck babies or what about pedophilia people who wants to fuck a ten year old. what about there rights?
your a fucken moron, you and your kin have a mental disorder...... and they have been well researched and charted as mental disorders you idiot..... ie ICD (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) &amp; with the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)
you madam are a mentally handicapped in every respect. you go and swear at me like i dont this is a cartoon..... your a fucken idiot, go be butthurt elsewhere you sjw bitch.... now fuck off
dont comment back cause ill carry on swearing at you like a little bitch you are</p>

        <p>So, if it's a cartoon... and ever references real life events... it's propaganda? lol.</p>
<p>I'm well aware of social engineering. It's what causes people like yourself to have the opinions you do. The fact that I'm the only person who replied to your comment just further proves my point that the people who are going to see anything related to this cartoon have to be looking for it. It doesn't mean what you said was at all accurate. Nor anything you've said since.</p>
<p>There was a time when homosexuality was considered a mental disorder. That time is not now. Shit changes, minds evolve, and knowledge grows. It's a way of life. Much like being gay and dealing with morons who don't believe I'm human enough is. That I dare to enjoy a cartoon while gay MUST mean social engineering? Ridiculous. I'm sorry if my initial comment hurt your heart so greatly. Admittedly, there was some gin involved, so maybe there was a bit more "mother fuck" than there would have been had I been sober. But the sentiment I feel is still exactly the same. I reacted to your nonsense. You responded with a whole lot more of it. And then had the gall to include how much you're not fazed by it. lol, Obviously.</p>
<p>Associating homosexuality with pedophilia is something you need to do to justify your hateful opinions. With all due respect (none, by the way), that's not my fucking problem. Molesting children has nothing to do with homosexuality. In fact, if you care to look into it so you'll actually know what you pretend to be so well versed in, the vast majority of sex offenders who committed their crimes against people of the same sex identify as heterosexual. Good try, though.</p>
