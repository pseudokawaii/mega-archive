    <strong>[META] Can we talk about rule 3?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey, I usually look for a smaller size in TV shows etc., for example the new episode of Saul. So I go to some other site delivering MEGA links. I just wonder: Why is the rule in place? The chances of the links getting taken down are not bigger or smaller than the rest of the links here. I would gladly provide links that aren't mine, because   </p>
<p>a. people wouldn't have to go through the pain of possible malware on their computer<br>
b. if those links get copyright problems it's not me having them<br>
c. this sub could be more up to date  </p></p>

        <p>And I'm telling you that this is how it is now, when I posted the Dr. Sapirstein fan edits a while back, he has his own blog with his edits upped to mega, I imported them &amp; posted them here &amp; when my links were dead within a day I went back to his links to reimport to repost &amp; they were dead, so I started paying attention &amp; probably 90% of the stuff I import from sites that use mega and post here as soon as it would go down I would go back &amp; check the original link &amp; it would be dead to. There is no way for me to really enforce this rule but if it keeps other sites from losing their links by just 1 person following it then it's all the better, because if I ran a site &amp; all of my mega links were dying within hours or days I might decide to stop using mega, then where would you get your files to import &amp; post here???</p>

        <p>From where they get all their stuff: Torrensites like Torrentleech etc. It's not like their are ripping their stuff themselves. You can actually follow the trail when you check new releases.    </p>
<p>By the way, didn't you say yourself that when you import stuff the original source gets killed as well? What difference does it make if you import your link from page x instead of using said link when both will be killed when reported anyways? Only solution to keep those safe is downloading the file and reuploading it (which I actually thought you did).  </p>

        <p>Yes I do &amp; have been since I realized this problem a long time ago but I have been getting messages from a few users that are seeing links on other sites die after the media on them is posted here, &amp; I'm sorry you don't agree with this, when you have over 34,000 users everyone isn't always going to agree with everything, but I talked with /u/indigo6alpha &amp; this is what's been agreed upon sorry if you don't like it.</p>

        <p>No, it's okay, I accept other people's opinions and it was just an idea. I have a new flat and I have to use their slow internet for a few more months so I can't contribute, this way I could've had. I just don't like the non-arguments of the "it's the truth because I say so" kind.  </p>
<p>Anyways, have a good evening altogether and thanks for the uploads, very appreciated.</p>

        <p>Thank you, it kills me how many links on other forums get taken down cuz someone shares the link outside the forum w/o permission. <em>angry walter voice</em> AM I THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES. The rule isn't the way it is "because they say so." It's the way it is because the admins (the people who moderate the thread, not just "they" they're not jus some random assholes) discussed the situation and formed the general consensus that they did. Meanwhile you think the admins should change the rules just because you say so and that the rules should cater to your situation not caring about how it affects the entire community.</p>

        <p>Links here get DMCAd much faster than other websites that use link shorteners.  I can go on a lot of those other websites and pull up links from 6+ months ago that are still active...not so much here.  I would rather we not ruin that.  It's not like we're short of content here anyway.</p>

        <p>Do you have any proof for what you are saying? Because I don't think so. La La Land was manually reported, here and on the usual websites. Nothing here or there is longer or shorter online from my experience. So do you have any statistics for that or is it just a feeling of yours? And obviously they update their links once they get taken down, which doesn't happen here often, people post a new update and don't update old posts (also Reddit posts are archived after 6 months, you can't update them). They don't post an update for the same quality, that's why you <em>think</em> they are online longer. </p>

<p>Wow, great argument. Since nobody else uses this sub for longer than a week, eh?. Like I said, just a feeling you try to sell as facts. I already explained why you are being fooled into thinking the links on websites are online longer. If you really think a PUBLIC website with text, pictures, IMDB links and everything is safer than this small sub, nobody outside Reddit even heard of, which uses all kinds of methods to not only obscure the name, but the links as well, I don't even know what to say, lol. I accept your argument, which I think is total nonsense and there is no need to discuss this any further, since you have no proof, just a "What I say is right" attitude. I've been downloading since Napster days, you are nothing special nor an expert.</p>

        <p>Yeah, noted, thanks for your expertise. I'm not getting pissy, I think you are an idiot for saying "I have no proof, I am just right, because I say so". What kind of discussion is that? Did that ever work out for you in real life?  </p>
<p>I could easily counter your bs by saying "well, great, if all the links here are taken down faster, then by bringing in "external" links everything would be online much longer". But of course by your logic because 50 people download them from here, they are super fast taken down and all the websites are doomed and close.  </p>
<p>I just don't feel the need to discuss anything with you any further, good luck in future arguments with the whole "I am right because I know it" stance, works brillant in the work place.</p>

        <p>Because the links from the sites such as tuserie or tumovie are being put up by someone else. You're taking credit from them, or bypassing the security they setup to protect their links. Therefore, the links would go down faster because we don't do much to protect those links.</p>
<p>If we had a link shortener policy in place, then I think we'd be more apt to change Rule 3.</p>

        <p>WTF are you talking about? Do you really think they put a lot of super hard work into what they are doing? They basically rip off torrent sites and use the work of warez groups to earn money by uploading them to MEGA. The "security and protection" consists of malware and link shorteners. You make it sound like they are some artists who I'm trying to rip off, lol. Way to play the moral card in a piracy forum. </p>

        <p>I'm aware it's not the most ethically sound argument, but it's a way to keep the links less exposed to web crawlers and other automated bots. I was simply trying to point out that links get taken down here faster, because of the nature of this subreddit.</p>

        <p>As far as the sub being more up to date... I've had an idea of a scripted bot that would automatically submit links to the sub. It has a lot of moving parts but how cool would that be?</p>
