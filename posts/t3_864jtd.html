    <p><p>no.103: <strong>Congratulations!</strong>  </p>
<p>Facebook is under fire after the Cambridge Analytica news broke, with the company holding an emergency staff meeting | Meanwhile, the CEO of Analytica has been suspended indefinitely, while investigations are pending | Package explosions rock Austin and San Antonio in Texas, as a serial bomber is on the loose, waking up memories of the Unabomber | Another high school shooting starts the news day, this time in Maryland, with two students injured, and a dead gunman | Trump congratulated Vladimir Putin for his election win, even though his national security advisers advised him in all caps to not congratulate him | Trump and Putin didn't talk about election meddling, didn't talk about the nerve gas murder in the UK, but probably talked about meeting each other "in the very near future" | And as always, the American media didn't learn of the Trump/Putin call from the White House, but from the Kremlin | Stephanie Clifford had a polygraph test, and it shows she is truthful about her 2006 relationship with Trump | James Comey's warning to Trump: "You will hear my story soon", which is essentially the start of the promotional tour of his upcoming book (cue lots of Comey appearances on MSNBC come mid-April) | Besides being embroiled in however many lawsuits, Trump now also has to deal with a defamation suit against him by former The Apprentice contestant Summer Zervis | Also, let's not forget about Karen McDougal, former Playboy model, who sues Trump to break silence | Whistleblower claims that Steve Bannon oversaw Cambridge Analytica's harvesting of Facebook user data  </p>
