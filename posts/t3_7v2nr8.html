    <strong>[MOVIE] Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country Director's Cut 1991 432p DVDrip AC3 x265 12bit hMCi 1.32GB with 2 commentaries, 2-CD OST and novelization</strong>

<p>This is the Director's Cut of the movie, taken from the 2004 DVD.  There is a comparison video of the changes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeGIlOUjkpQ">here.</a>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As with the other nine Star Trek films, <em>The Undiscovered Country</em> was re-released on DVD as a Special Edition in 2004. Meyer, who stated he dislikes director's cuts, nevertheless found "a couple of moments that I thought were not clear", and re-edited them as "I suddenly saw how to make them clear." Among the elements added for home video were a briefing with the Federation president where Admiral Cartwright and Colonel West unveil their plan for rescuing Kirk and McCoy, and a scene where Spock and Scott inspect the torpedoes. Some shots were reordered or replaced, with wide-angle shots replacing close angles and vice versa.</p>

        <p>Is the runtime 1:49:58? That'd match my 'best quality' file. Which matches the count of commentary tracks.</p>
<p>Or is it perhaps 1:53:16? That's a significantly lower rez copy I kept, probably due to the mismatch. If that's the runtime, I'll be replacing my copy of it because of the commentaries being clearly different. </p>
<p>Thanks for your help keeping the editions straight, as well as uploading it!</p>

        <p>It indicates that I typed 1080p out of habit, as most of my rips have been 1080p.  It's a dvd rip.  It's fixed now.  Thanks for the heads-up.</p>

        <p>If you're looking the 1080p 10Bit Joy release has 2 commentaries and a run-time that looks like it was the bluray source (1:49:58). Not sure on a current link for it =/</p>

        <p>Not that I know of.  Paramount seems to have had a firm hand on limiting these films.  Only 3 out of the current 12 have more than one version.  They also gave Shatner a flat No when he asked that they do a director's cut of <em>Star Trek V,</em> although that would have included paying for the cgi for his abandoned 'rock monster' in the film's climax.<br>
Curiously, while they spent a fair bit of coin on producing extras for the dvd Collector's Editions they seemed to go the cheap route on the blu-rays which have almost new no material and <a href="http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Motion-Picture-Collection-Blu-ray/6408/#Review">several poor transfers.</a>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Star Trek: Generations makes its highly anticipated Blu-ray debut with something of a hit-or-miss 1080p, 2.39:1-framed transfer. This release of Generations features virtually no visible film grain; <strong>it doesn't look as positively lifeless as some of the titles found in the original crew Blu-ray releases, but it nevertheless appears to have been digitally manipulated.</strong> The transfer also features flesh tones that take a turn towards the red end of the spectrum, several shots that go extremely soft, edge enhancement here and there, and at least two instances where major blocking is plainly visible: once in the Amargosa station as Riker and Worf investigate the attack, and later in one of the film's last scenes as Riker and Picard reminisce on Veridian III. Nevertheless, all is not completely lost. Fine detail can look good in places; there's a shot featuring Geordi and Data looking at the emotion chip, and viewers will be able to see the Lieutenant-Commander's eyes blinking behind the visor. During the final act and on the surface of Veridian III, fine texture and detail on the planet's rocky terrain looks rather good. Colors tend to remain a rather neutral shade, though the red Starfleet command uniforms tend to stand out from the crowd as far brighter than any other shade. There's a good transfer here yearning to be let loose, but there's too much going, particularly in the form of noise reduction, that puts a damper on the party.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between this, <em>The Next Generations'</em> poor blu-ray sales (after Paramount sank $12 million into restoration) and <em>Beyond's</em> failure it makes me wonder what Paramount's attitude is towards future franchise releases.  Will these continue to be poor home media releases as Paramount tries to limit costs in a franchise with diminishing returns?</p>
