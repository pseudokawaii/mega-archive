    <strong>[Audiobook] Wages of Rebellion: The Moral Imperative of Revolt - Chris Hedges (124.7 MB)</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/YOI6w">Cover</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revolutions come in waves and cycles. We are again riding the crest of a revolutionary epic, much like 1848 or 1917, from the Arab Spring to movements against austerity in Greece to the Occupy movement. In Wages of Rebellion, Chris Hedges—who has chronicled the malaise and sickness of a society in terminal moral decline in his books Empire of Illusion and Death of the Liberal Class—investigates what social and psychological factors cause revolution, rebellion, and resistance. Drawing on an ambitious overview of prominent philosophers, historians, and literary figures he shows not only the harbingers of a coming crisis but also the nascent seeds of rebellion. Hedges' message is clear: popular uprisings in the United States and around the world are inevitable in the face of environmental destruction and wealth polarization.</p>
<p>Focusing on the stories of rebels from around the world and throughout history, Hedges investigates what it takes to be a rebel in modern times. Utilizing the work of Reinhold Niebuhr, Hedges describes the motivation that guides the actions of rebels as “sublime madness” — the state of passion that causes the rebel to engage in an unavailing fight against overwhelmingly powerful and oppressive forces. For Hedges, resistance is carried out not for its success, but as a moral imperative that affirms life. Those who rise up against the odds will be those endowed with this “sublime madness.”</p>
<p>From South African activists who dedicated their lives to ending apartheid, to contemporary anti-fracking protests in Alberta, Canada, to whistleblowers in pursuit of transparency, Wages of Rebellion shows the cost of a life committed to speaking the truth and demanding justice. Hedges has penned an indispensable guide to rebellion. -<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168271-wages-of-rebellion">goodreads</a></p>

        <p>And there is a soundtrack for rebellion. Or that song that would put us in the mood. It is from a Canadian band, generally known as <a href="http://cstrecords.com/thee-silver-mt-zion/">The Silver Mt. Zion</a> (they went through name changes when their components changed). Their work is all phenomenal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/megalinks/comments/7q4604/music_discographies_godspeed_you_black_emperor/">check it out here</a> (well, go ahead and download the other band there as well, download it all. you will thank me later).</p>
<p>However, the focus of this comment is the "Movie (Never Made)". I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdMSAy9o5l0">put the youtube version</a> just for a quick glance to see what I mean. The second verse is the soul of this song, which I show here just to ensure I get the point across:</p>
<pre><code>Let's kill first the banker
With his professional demeanor
Let's televise and broadcast the raping of kings
Let our crowds be fed on tear gas and plate glass
'cos the people united is a wonderful thing
</code></pre>
<p>Imagining those scenes above brings tears to my eyes. Always. Honestly, what makes this song special for me is that verse. Otherwise it is just ok, nothing that special. Maybe that was their intent, just to put some sound in the background to vent out some beautiful stuff. However, they do have a lot of very good stuff. Download it all, you will not regret it.</p>
