<p>Stephanie Clifford sues Donald Trump over nondisclosure agreement, which he didn't sign | Clifford apparently has some sext messages and indecent pictures (cue the dick pics!) from her affair with Trump in 2006, and now everyone is excited and scared about what will happen when those get out into the public | Trump denies chaos in the West Wing after Gary Cohn's departure | Kushner still working as a foreign policy adviser, meeting with Mexico's president days after his security clearance was downgraded | Trump's personal lawyer continues to deny that the President had a sexual encounter with a porn star, plus at least a week ago Michael Cohen tried to silence Clifford through the law | Trump ignored legal advice and talked to Mueller's witnesses about matters discussed in the Russia probe | GOP lawmakers express doubts about Trump's tariffs, the day after Paul Ryan urged his colleagues not to bully Trump over the tariffs | Meanwhile, Trump offers Mexico and Canada temporary tariff exemptions | Florida House passes new gun safety bill, the first gun reform bill in the state in 22 years  </p>
