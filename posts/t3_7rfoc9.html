    <strong>[DOCUMENTARY] The Fruitless Tree (2018 Deutsche Welle DocFilms) [720p WEBRip | x264 | 96 AAC] [807MB]</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Married, but childless - there can hardly be a greater disgrace for Muslim women in Niger. Almost always, women are blamed for this. Few bravely decide to go their own way and live their own lives.</strong>  </p>
<p>Having no children is simply unimaginable in Niger, Aicha Macky says. Although the doctors cannot establish any medical reason in her case, she hasnâ€™t been able to conceive. Her mother-in-law abuses her as a "fruitless tree." In strictly hierarchical Muslim societies, the cause of infertility is rarely sought among the men - the woman is almost always blamed. Aicha Macky tells her own touching story in this film. Her mother died giving birth to one of her siblings; in quiet reflection, she asks for advice from the dead woman and tries to overcome her sadness. That women openly talk about this issue at all is bordering on taboo in Niger. Aicha says this film has helped her to find herself. No longer willing to be excluded from society, she is bravely going her own way.  </p>
