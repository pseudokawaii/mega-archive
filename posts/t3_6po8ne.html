<p>Folder Size: 4.23 MB      <br>
Description: This folder contains three ePUBs, one is 3in1 collection of three books:     <br>
1.The Golden Compass <br>
2.The Subtle Knife  <br>
3.The Amber Spyglass   <br>
Second file is Lyra's Oxford, and the last one is Once Upon a Time in the North</p>
<p>Why is Northern Lights called The Golden Compass?   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The title change for the first book of His Dark Materials has been the source of endless confusion for fans on both sides of the Atlantic, and the rationale behind the change isn't entirely clear. When the book was first published in the United Kingdom, it was called Northern Lights. However, when it was published in North America, it was renamed The Golden Compass.      </p>
<p>Apparently, Pullman's original name for the series was The Golden Compass Says..., and that was the name under which he sent it off to American publishers. He heard nothing from them for months, and in the interim, decided (with his British publisher's full blessing) to rename the series His Dark Materials. Months later, RandomHouse sent a letter to inform him that they would be thrilled to publish The Golden Compass and, when Pullman explained that the name had changed, insisted that the cover artwork was already slated to publicly appear the following month, and it was too late to change the title.     </p>
<p>Regardless of the name, the two books are essentially the same beast (minus the art by Philip Pullman that headed up the chapters in the UK version).     </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, as you could have guessed, it's the US version by RandomHouse Publications.     </p></p>

        <p>Apart from the name change of book 1- Northern Lights to The Golden Compass in the USA editions just so people are aware the USA version of The Golden Compass is also CENSORED</p>
<p>The "His Dark Materials" trilogy is the greatest set of books EVER written. After 17 years the first part of the companion novel trilogy is due out this October! I've been reading this series since the first book in 1995 so to say i'm passionate about this series is an understatement. PLEASE READ THESE BOOKS! </p>
<p>Thanks to the poster for sharing but i would recommend the English published books and the Audiobook narrated by Pullman himself and full cast not the bbc radio dramatizations </p>

        <p>Hey, dude/dudette! Thanks for your insight. I was wondering the same thing, since when I was reading Wikipedia's info on the trilogy I found out about the censorship on sexuality. I really wanna read this trilogy, since it's so well recommended (I didn't look up for more info since I don't want to spoil anything). 
Just a question, do you know where to find the version you just described? Maybe you have them or something. I'd really appreciate. Or, in case you don't, do I just have to look up for them with the names you said? How should I look them up as?
Thanks a lot!</p>

        <p>a legit purchase is probably worth it the only ebooks i could find are epubs/pdfs of the american versions. I do have the audible audiobooks and google play store e-book versions so if anyone knows how to strip copy protection/drm and personally identifiable info out of them i would be willing to upload them.</p>
<p>They truly are the best books i've ever read and want as many people as possible to read them</p>

        <p>Yeah, mate. I just spend a good amount of time searching for uncensored versions, and found nothing so far. I guess I'll just have to read these :) Thanks anyway</p>
<p>(By the way, do you recommend any other saga?)</p>
