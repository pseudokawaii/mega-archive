    <strong>[GAME] 3DS decrypted rom mega collection for use with Citra: Part 6 [11.97 GB]</strong>
    <p><p>Did you think I was finished?</p>
<p>Fool! I was merely giving your quota a chance to recover (or download something else).</p>
<p>Snaph.it Link: http://links.snahp.it/66hanafuda6</p>
<p>I've encoded the password into base64. Decode this to get the password: </p>
<p>ZGlkeW91bWlzc21l</p>
<p>As usual, replace the "xxxx" in the link with "mega". You had better appreciate this level of simplicity while you can. When I make a unified 3DS rom batch, I'm going to put you through every trick in the book to obfuscate the link. I'm thinking of making you decode an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF9GYoHbKEg">SSTV signal</a> and more.</p>
<p>This is my sixth set of decrypted 3DS roms for use with the 3DS emulator Citra.</p>
<p>Included games are:</p>
<p>Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer</p>
<p>Attack on Titan - Humanity in Chains</p>
<p>Castlevania Lords of Shadow Mirror of Fate</p>
<p>Centipede Infestation</p>
<p>Cooking Mama 4 - Kitchen Magic</p>
<p>Cooking Mama 5 - Bon Appetit!</p>
<p>Disney Epic Mickey The Power of Illusion</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Explorers</p>
<p>Fossil Fighters Frontier</p>
<p>Gardening Mama 2 - Forest Friends</p>
<p>Harvest Moon 3D - A New Beginning</p>
<p>Harvest Moon Skytree Village</p>
<p>Hatsune Miku Project Mirai DX</p>
<p>Langrisser Re Incarnation -Tensei</p>
<p>Legend of Legacy</p>
<p>Lord of Magna Maiden Heaven</p>
<p>Mario Party Star Rush</p>
<p>Mario Sports Superstars</p>
<p>Mario Tennis Open</p>
<p>Mario vs Donkey Kong Tipping Stars</p>
<p>Metroid Prime Federation Force</p>
<p>Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Generations</p>
<p>I think Batch 7 will go up tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Batch 8 will probably be my last 3DS batch. Then I'll move on to something new.</p>
<p>So if you have any suggestions for what I should upload next, let me know. I'm thinking of making a complete collection of the various BIOS/System files used by various emulators.</p>
<p>Other ideas:</p>
<p>Games that were once on GOG or Steam but have since been removed.</p>
<p>A collection of some of the more obscure ScummVM games (did you know that the same maniacs who animated Hotel Mario and two of the three Zelda games for CD-I made point and click adventure games as well?)</p>
<p>I'm DEFINITELY going to upload Daphne and Singe roms and video files in some sort of "FMV game mega collection". Although this will be more for my sake than for yours. As Linus Torvalds once said "Only wimps use tape backup: real men just upload their important stuff on ftp, and let the rest of the world mirror it ;)". You have NO IDEA how much of a pain in the ass it was to track all games down.</p>
<p>I might also be interested in uploading original Xbox games. I downloaded a bunch for my softmodded orignal Xbox. They are much harder to find than PS2 or Gamecube ISOs (until Nintendo forced some sites to take some games down).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I might also be interested in uploading some gamecube games in .gcz format for Dolphin or Wii games in .wbfs format for either Dolphin or a softmodded Wii.</p></p>

        <p>Ohhhh snap. Just finished downloading something else so my quota is gone :( also, I did think you were done, was checking in all weekend haha.</p>
<p>Do you by chance have disgae, fire emblem fates, or Xenoblade chronicles?  </p>
<p>Also, I havnt played around with it yet, but so you know if regular DS games would work on citra? Or if there's another emulator out there for it.</p>

        <p>Xenoblade is New 3DS only. I only have the old model, and Citra can't emulate New 3DS games.</p>
<p>But it's a remake of the original Xenoblade Chronicles, right? I happen to have actual physical discs of all three "Project Rainfall" games. I could upload them if you want.</p>
<p>As for Fire Emblem Fates: it'll be in batch 8.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've run into a problem.</p>
<p>The short version is that all 3DS games are encrypted to prevent piracy. As evidenced by the fact that Citra only works with decrypted roms, they didn't do a very good job.</p>
<p>However, some newer 3DS games come with a better type of encryption. This includes Fire Emblem Fates and Echoes, as well as a few other games.</p>
<p>To decrypt them, I need a file called "seeddb.bin". Fortunately, I can get this file by running a certain Homebrew program on my hacked 2DS. Unfortunately, I can't get this program to run, probably because my 2DS is running version 5.5 of Luma3DS when the most recent version is 8.0.</p>
<p>The instructions for upgrading that I found online looked like a pain in the ass, so I put it off for another day.</p>
<p>I'd rather not turn my 2DS into a paperweight if I can help it.</p>
<p>Fire Emblem Fates tl;dr</p>
<p>Soonâ„¢. Probably.
EDIT: As for Disgaea, there aren't any games in the series on the 3DS. I'd rather not upload PSP or PS2 games since emuparadise has a good selection in both. But... I might be able to upload the PS3 games for use with RPCS3. Possibly even the Vita game(s) if I can get my hands on a hacked/hackable Vita.  </p>
<p>EDIT2: As for DS emulation, Citra doesn't do that.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the DS emulator scene is doing better now than it ever has. DeSmuME was the undisputed king for several years now, but it had a few problems. For example, DeSmuME can't render games at a higher-than-native resolution. I can't seem to find a picture to show what difference this makes, but believe me, it's a BIG difference. Also, Wi-Fi connections were not emulated. The most obvious problem is the fact that the developers don't care about Pokemon. That is, they practically refuse to acknowledge the existence of Pokemon games when they do the coding. </p>
<p>However, people have finally decided that enough is enough. THREE new DS emulators started development in 2016. MelonDS, which has ALREADY developed enough wifi emulation to be able to have two instances of MelonDS (on the same computer) pictochatting.</p>
<p>Medusa is currently being worked on by the same person who made the excellent mGBA emulator. I haven't heard much about it since it was first announced on April 1st (which also happens to be the same day Freeman's Mind 2: Episode 1 was upload).  GBE+ has recently been development too</p>

        <p>Yea, that's always my fear when trying to hack devices.. I'm consider myself decently computer literate, but it still freaks me out a bit.  Thanks for all you've done btw!  </p>
<p>Edit: as for xenoblade, if it is the same as the wii game, then I wouldn't bother for my sake.  I don't have a wii, and I don't have a wii emulator (if one even exists).</p>

<p>I'm American, so the only PAL isos I have are those that weren't released in America. Off the top of my head, that would be just Another Code: R - A Journey into Lost Memories and  Disaster: Day of Crisis.</p>

        <p>Hey man as u near the end of your 3ds uploads I want to thank you for introducing me to 3DS emulation. I had played all the Pokemon games until X and y came out and I tried a lot to find the roms and methods of emulation only to be greeted with viruses and surveys .</p>
<p>So when a couple of weeks back I stumbled upon to your 3ds collection I was out of the world happy since it contained so many games I was dying to play . Sure most of the games don't work due to citra and most lag due to my low end pc but keeping a backup of these valuable files only shall help in the future !!!!</p>
<p>I really thank you with all my heart and with regards to the suggestion of what u might upload next, Any WII games with a link / guide on how to emulate them will  helpful</p>
<p>I am so happy I found out this sub and really thank you again for your uploads
Regardless of what u upload next I shall forever be grateful :)</p>

<p>A collection of some of the more obscure ScummVM games (did you know that the same maniacs who animated Hotel Mario and two of the three Zelda games for CD-I made point and click adventure games as well?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a huge complete-ish collection out there called Gruby's AdventurePack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm DEFINITELY going to upload Daphne and Singe roms and video files in some sort of "FMV game mega collection". Although this will be more for my sake than for yours. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking forward to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So if you have any suggestions for what I should upload next, let me know.</p>

<p>Any interesting obscure adventure games (point and click-style or otherwise) that only had a console release.</p>

        <p>A nice share would be the Aristocrat emulator and ROMs, with games such as Indian Dreaming, 50 Lions, Atlantis, Orchid, etc., what we here in Australia call 'poker machines'.</p>
