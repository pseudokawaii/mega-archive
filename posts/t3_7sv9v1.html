<p>Great movie adaption of a book by the great director John Milius. It draws heavily in his style to revere similar great works by Kipling and Conrad. The story is great and the battle sequences are fantastic. Its the tell of a man tired of the"civilized world" and its conflict. He then secured his own piece of paradise and lead a peaceful tribe. Because of WW2 the peace could not last long as the threat of incursion becomes a sad reality. He rallys his people into battle to ensure their survival, but also to protect their lifestyle and liberty. It really is a romantic movie. Its universal in its themes and really can connect with you. I'd highly recommend it.</p></p>
