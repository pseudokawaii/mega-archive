    <p><p>no.98: <strong>Things That Collapse</strong>  </p>
<p>Trump touts his making up of alternative facts during a meeting with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau | GOP claims that apparent PA-18 special election winner Conor Lamb "ran like a Republican", conveniently forgetting all their anti-Lamb ads, which had him depicted as Nancy Pelosi's sheep | Robert Mueller subpoenas Trump Organization, demands documents involving Russia, which means chaos time in Trump's mind | Now that Mueller has apparently crossed Trump's "red line", suspense is pending | Trump is in the mood to fire people: His National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster is on his way out (or is he?); John Kelly and Jeff Sessions can also expect a "You're fired" tweet; and even Andrew McCabe, who retires on Sunday, is fearing for his job | The mood in the White House is supposedly "verging on mania" | US imposes new (first) Russia sanctions over 2016 elections, but Trump likes to use the "excuse" of the poisoning of the former Russian spy and his daughter in the UK for his decisions to impose the sanctions | DHS reveals Russian cyberattacks on US nuclear power plants | A newly constructed pedestrian bridge in Miami collapses and kills at least four  </p>
