    <strong>[MUSIC] Wintersun - The Forest Package (The Forest Seasons, Time I 1.5 Remaster, Wintersun 2.0 Remaster and More)</strong>
    <p><p>.nz/#F!lfZmBLCR</p>

<p>This is the entire Forest Package from a torrent that I'm uploading as a big fuck you to Jari for making such a shitty cash-grab album. It has everything from The Forest Package with the exception of the Master Files for the 3 albums, which I can't find anywhere online. I suspect the file sizes are so large they're not even worth dealing with. This new album is pretty bad, and the "remasters" are a joke because <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wintersun/posts/10155152103502402:0">Jari literally said</a> all he did was tweak a few things and use some plugins to make them sound a bit better. So if that's a remaster then hooray. Everything included in this package is:</p>
<p>-The Forest Seasons in MP3 320kbps, with Instrumentals and Isolated Tracks</p>
<p>-The Loneliness Winter Track from the Forest Seasons in an Acoustic version, with an Instrumental version on top of that</p>
<p>-A Live Album from 2013 from Tuska</p>
<p>-Time I 1.5 "Remaster", with an Instrumental Version and Isolated Tracks</p>
<p>-Wintersun 2.0 "Remaster"</p>
<p>Oh, and for anyone who feels bad downloading all these albums, don't be. Go find the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign and have a laugh. He expects his fans to give him something like $800,000 over the course of 3 Crowdfunding Campaigns and charged like $60 for this entire package. None of the diehard fans will even critique the album on Facebook when its obviously lacking in comparison to his other works, and a lot of the fans even went out and bought physical copies on top of crowdfunding, you can just scroll through the Wintersun Facebook to see all that cancer.</p></p>

        <p>Is it possible you also upload the high res scans of the Forest Seasons Booklet and the 5K Wallpapers? That would be awesome!</p>
