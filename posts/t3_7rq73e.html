    <strong>[EBOOK/PACK] The Complete Hannibal Lecter Series by Thomas Harris</strong>
    <p><blockquote>
<p>Thomas Harris (born April 11, 1940) is an American author and screenwriter, best known for a series of suspense novels about his most famous character, Hannibal Lecter. All of his works have been made into films, the most notable being the multi-Oscar winning The Silence of the Lambs, which became only the third film in Academy Award history to sweep the Oscars in major categories.</p>
<p>Hannibal Lecter is a fictional character in a series of horror novels by Thomas Harris.</p>
<p>Lecter was introduced in the 1981 thriller novel Red Dragon as a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. The novel and its sequel, The Silence of the Lambs, feature Lecter as the secondary antagonist after the two serial killers in both novels. In the third novel, Hannibal Lecter becomes a main character. His role as the antihero occurs in the fourth novel, Hannibal Rising, which explores his childhood and development into a serial killer.</p>
<p>The collection includes four books of Hannibal series - </p>
<p>*Red Dragon</p>
<p>*Silence of the Lambs</p>
<p>*Hannibal</p>
<p>*Hannibal Rising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Format - AZW3; EPUB; MOBI.</em></p>
<p><strong>Red Dragon (Hannibal Lecter #1)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sexual hunger; demonic violence; sinister logic - the lethal components of a deadly formula driving a psychopath in the grip of an unimagin-able delusion; a boastful killer who sends the police tormenting notes; a tortured, torturing monster who finds ultimate pleasure in viciously murdering happy families, and calls himself. . . The Red Dragon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Silence of the Lambs (Hannibal Lecter #2)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a killer on the loose who knows that beauty is only skin deep, and a trainee investigator who's trying to save her own hide. The only man that can help is locked in an asylum. But he's willing to put a brave face on — if it will help him escape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Hannibal (Hannibal Lecter #3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years after his escape, posing as scholarly Dr. Fell, curator of a grand family's palazzo, Hannibal lives the good life in Florence, playing lovely tunes by serial killer/composer Henry VIII and killing hardly anyone himself. Clarice is unluckier: in the novel's action-film-like opening scene, she survives an FBI shootout gone wrong, and her nemesis, Paul Krendler, makes her the fall guy. Clarice is suspended, so, unfortunately, the first cop who stumbles on Hannibal is an Italian named Pazzi, who takes after his ancestors, greedy betrayers depicted in Dante's Inferno. Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish. His obsession is to feed Lecter to some other brutal pets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Hannibal Rising (Hannibal Lecter #4)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hannibal Lecter emerges from the nightmare of the Eastern Front, a boy in the snow, mute, with a chain around his neck. </p>
<p>He seems utterly alone, but he has brought his demons with him.</p>
<p>Hannibal’s uncle, a noted painter, finds him in a Soviet orphanage and brings him to France, where Hannibal will live with his uncle and his uncle’s beautiful and exotic wife, Lady Murasaki.</p>
<p>Lady Murasaki helps Hannibal to heal. With her help he flourishes, becoming the youngest person ever admitted to medical school in France.</p>
<p>But Hannibal’s demons visit him and torment him. When he is old enough, he visits them in turn.</p>
<p>He discovers he has gifts beyond the academic, and in that epiphany, Hannibal Lecter becomes death’s prodigy. </p>
