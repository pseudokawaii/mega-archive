<p>A medieval Italian wastrel becomes Francis of Assisi, founder of an order under Pope Innocent III. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli.Zeffirelli's version of this great man depicts a 70's genre of his early life from his return from the Padua Wars till he was received and recognized by Pope Innocent III. The film is visually well done but should have been in Technicolor to enhance effectiveness. It appears to have been filmed on location in Umbria with scenes in the town of Assisi. Graham Faulkner and Jodi Bowker are very believable as St Francis and St Clair. Compassion erupts from both of them on the screen. All this is entwined in the music by Donovan which provides powerful scenes to capture the period and surrounding</p></p>
