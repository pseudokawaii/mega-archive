    <strong>[TV] [Music] Supaidāman with Extras (Japanese Spider-Man) (Subbed Web-Rips) [10.30 GB]</strong>
    <p><p>I previously uploaded this series but have since found it in better quality. The previous uploaded was FLV format, these are MKV. Password is the name of the sub.</p>

<p>Myspleen description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VERSION 2: for those that downloaded the first version of this torrent, my apologies. the noticeable audio drift that was occurring in episodes 2 through 9 but not in the others drove me to investigate the problem further. </p>
<p>it appears that episodes 1 through 12 in my original upload, sourced from a torrent on BakaBT, were transcodes made from yet another torrent. in the case of eps. 2~9, the transcode was done improperly so that the video ran at 24.00 fps while the audio ran at 23.98 fps, causing a gradual lag that was very noticeable by the end of the episode. </p>
<p>this was confirmed by not only finding a torrent of those episodes encoded in VP6F (a typical web player format, unlike XVID) with very slightly better video quality despite much smaller file sizes and no audio sync issues, but also by applying a 1000/1001 audio stretch in the MKV metadata to eps. 2~9 of my original upload, which fixed the problem perfectly. nevertheless, since i STRONGLY suspect the VP6F files are a generation up from the XVID files in the old torrent, i've replaced eps. 1-12 with these newly found files. </p>
<p>the Movie, which i placed between eps. 10 and 11 as it should be, is not affected and was not replaced.</p>
<p>if you snatched the first torrent, simply grab this new file and your client will checksum and redownload eps. 1-12. nothing else has changed. sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>produced by Toei and ran on what is now TV Tokyo from May 17, 1978 to March 14, 1979.</p>
<p>episodes are web rips from when Marvel posted the series on their site in 2009, compiled from a couple of public torrents and repacked into MKV. you want this torrent though, because the original files all had incorrect aspect ratios which have been corrected here with MKV flags.</p>
<p>for extras, there's the trailer for the theatrical episode and an interview with Stan Lee (thankfully not dubbed in Japanese).</p>
<p>eps. 1–12 are VP6F/MP3
everything else is XVID/MP3
Japanese audio with English hard subs (except the trailer, oh well)</p>
<p>i've also included the official soundtrack CD, Eccentric Sound of Spiderman in FLAC. (released in 2001, seems to be OOP now)</p>
