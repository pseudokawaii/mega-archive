<p>"Jackson Brodie (Golden Globe® nominee Jason Isaacs, Harry Potter, The Patriot) used to be a soldier in the British army and then an officer in the Lothian and Borders Police. Now the tough detective has turned private investigator, compelled to bring peace to victims and their families. Based in Edinburgh, the good-hearted Brodie finds himself looking into everything from lost cats to wayward spouses and killers on the run. He does a lot of running himself, partly to unwind from the stresses of his work, but mostly to escape the memories of his own traumatic past.</p>
<p>Seen on Masterpiece Mystery, this "more than successful adaptation" (The Guardian, U.K.) of Kate Atkinson’s award-winning novels also stars Amanda Abbington (Agatha Christie’s Poirot), Natasha Little (Vanity Fair), Phil Davis (Vera Drake), and Keith Allen (Robin Hood). Created for television by Ashley Pharaoh of Life on Mars, this character-driven drama features sharp scripts and an outstanding lead performance by Isaacs, all set against the ruggedly beautiful Scottish scenery."</p></p>
