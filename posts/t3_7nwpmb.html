    <strong>[DOCUMENTARY] Soundhunters: A Musical Expedition (2018 Deutsche Welle DocFilms) [720p WEBRip | x264 | 125 AAC] [756MB]</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Sound pioneers have experimented with everyday sounds for centuries. Now this music is coming back. The French duo KIZ take a trip from the beginnings of this genre to the present day. Who are today’s sound artists?</strong>  </p>
<p>Music constructed from everyday sounds has enjoyed great success in pop and rock music. Our film follows the French duo KIZ as they chart this music from its beginnings to the present day. Who are today's sound artists? Where do they get their inspiration? And how have they developed their art? Our explorers visit musicians from different generations, both established artists and newcomers. They are at home in a variety of styles - from pop and jazz to noise and electronic music using fascinating sound installations. KIZ's first port of call is London, where they meet multi-instrumentalist Cosmo Sheldrake who uses a recording device and a laptop to capture the sounds around him for his often humorous work. Matthew Herbert followed the life of a pig from birth to death and made a whole album from the noises he recorded. Then we head via Paris and Berlin to New York. And pioneers of experimental electronics like Blixa Bargeld of Einstürzende Neubauten and Jean-Michel Jarre show us how to get the best out of noise and voices.  </p>

        <p>Sounds fascinating, though admittedly I was skeptic at first. There's a shitty satirical hiphop band in Germany called K.I.Z.</p>
