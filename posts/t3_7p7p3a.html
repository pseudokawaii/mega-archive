<p>Enjoy and PLEASE re-share this (torrents, IRC etc EVERYWHERE). People need to know this valuable information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was a thriving, young doctor with a promising career ahead of me. Then, within a short amount of time (it felt like it was almost overnight), my entire life changed. Suddenly, depression and anxiety were constant companions and I had such extreme fatigue I couldn’t even get out of bed some mornings.</p>
<p>What was I supposed to do? Everything I did required optimal brain function. Without a healthy brain, I couldn’t see patients, do research, workout, or connect with loved ones.. I was at a loss. Discovering Functional Medicine and the power of our body to heal saved me from lifelong depression, anxiety, and fatigue.</p>
<p>And this is just my story. Thousands of other patients and many other practitioners have their own story about how Functional Medicine empowered them to take control of their health and treat their mysterious or not so mysterious illnesses.</p>
<p>I know there are many other people out there who are suffering from a brain disorder and cannot seem to find any answers. This is why I wanted to show the world that there is a possibility of recovering from a broken brain. It all starts with recognizing that our body is an elegantly designed and connected system, not just a bunch of individual parts that have nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>This means that everything you do to your body, you do to your brain.</p>
<p>The epidemic of broken brains is not getting any better. Alzheimer’s disease will affect 30 percent (and some experts say 50 percent) of people over 85 years old. Psychiatric disorders affect 26 percent of our adult population or over 60 million Americans. These are just some of the statistics. It’s time we put a stop to this epidemic.</p>
<p>This is why I made a docuseries about brain health. With the help of my friends, patients, and colleagues, I wanted to show you how you can take a different approach to treating brain disorders. Conventional medicine has its place in treatment, but what does it take to truly fix our brains? How can we get to the root cause of dis-ease?</p>
<p>In the Broken Brain docuseries, we interviewed over 50 experts about topics such as Alzheimer’s, dementia, ADHD, autism, depression, anxiety, traumatic brain injury, and more. Above, I’ve included a highlight reel that touches on a few of the topics we cover in this 8-part docuseries. You’ll hear from experts who have transformed the way we practice medicine…</p>
<p>Episode 1: In our opening episode, I share more about my experience with a broken brain and we hear from experts such as Dr. Terry Wahls and Jim Kwik about their own experiences with brain dysfunction. We also talk about what has led to this epidemic of broken brains and what to expect throughout the docuseries.</p>
<p>Episode 2: The gut-brain connection has been gaining popularity in recent years, and for a good reason! This connection might be one of the key pieces of the puzzle when treating your brain. Learn why from Dr. David Perlmutter, Dr. Martha Herbert, Dr. Raphael Kellman, Dr. Frank Lipman, Dr. Sid Baker, Dr. Jeffrey Bland and more.</p>
<p>Episode 3: Alzheimer’s and dementia are devastating brain disorders that rob elderly of their past. Unfortunately, even middle-aged individuals are suffering from memory loss. What is causing the increase in dementia and Alzheimer’s and is there anything we can do about it? Some of the experts you’ll hear from in this episode include Dr. Ann Hathaway, Dr. Dale Bredesen, Max Lugavere, Dr. Rudy Tanzi, and Dr. David Perlmutter.</p>
<p>Episode 4: Are autism and ADHD just names we give to people with a list of similar symptoms? You might be surprised to hear that treating patients with ADHD or on the autism spectrum does not look so different from treating patients who have dementia or other illnesses. Dr. Susan Goh, Chris Kresser, and others will take us through a revolutionary new way to look at these disorders.</p>
<p>Episode 5: Depression is the leading cause of disability in America. Anxiety plagues more and more people every single day. Dr. Drew Ramsey, Dr. Robin Berzin and Pedram Shojai are a few of the experts who dive deep into depression and anxiety in Episode 5.</p>
<p>Episode 6: When suffering from a traumatic brain injury, conventional medicine often fails to provide the right support that we need to recover. Functional Medicine takes a different approach. Learn about this approach in Episode 6 where we feature the miraculous story of recovery from a broken brain. Experts JJ Virgin, Dr. David Musnick and Dr. Titus Chiu show you how everything we do, including exercise, relaxation, what we eat, and more, can change the brain.</p>
<p>Episodes 7 &amp; 8: We take all of the advice outlined by our experts and turn them into practical steps that you can take today toward a better brain.</p>
<p>This docuseries will completely change the way you think about brain health, and I want to invite you to watch it.</p>
<p>Also, chances are you know someone with a broken brain. Help to spread the message about this docuseries by sharing it with your friends and family.</p>
<p>Let’s take back our health, together."</p>

        <p>For some reason I can't download episode 3. Basically what's happening is that it's completing the download and then as soon as it's finished it goes back to 0% and restarts. Any chance you can reupload episode 3 to zippyshare? Thanks.</p>
