    <strong>[PODCAST] The Tools: Coming Alive: A Conversation with Brain Carroll AKA Buckethead 192Kb/s AAC [80MB]</strong>
    <p><p><a href="http://links.snahp.it/964BHBC">Link</a> PASSWORD is wedge</p>
<hr>
<p>A conversation Between Buckethead and his psychotherapist Barry Michael of <a href="https://www.thetoolsbook.com/">The Tools</a>. In this episode of Coming Alive, Barry talks to Buckethead, whose real name is Brian Carroll. In his first full-length interview ever (yes, it's really him!), Brian talks about:</p>
<p>♫ His Part X and how he uses the Tools to fight his fears</p>
<p>♫ How he learned to focus on bringing his gifts to the world instead of worrying about what others think of him</p>
<p>♫ How some major life challenges—including the death of his parents, a back injury, and heart problems—have imbued his music with more feeling</p>
<p>♫ What it feels like to be in a flow state and how to enhance the creative process</p>
<p>♫ His biggest influences and sources of inspiration, including Barry, Bootsy Collins, Paul Gilbert, Shawn Lane, and Michael Jordan. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: This is not an interview with his Buckethead persona. This is Brian being transparent and vulnerable. This is very personal interview and I can imagine one of the biggest obstacles for him to overcome. Brian has been working on being comfortable within and outside himself, how his inadequacies towards himself and outwards about his fears of what people think of him. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you listen to this keep your mind open. It's very emotionally charged. Brian is very nervous in the beginning, he's always let his music speak for him. His parents passed away in 2014 &amp; 2015 respectively and he has a difficult time talking about it. Throughout the conversation you can hear a tone of confidence and comforability as the conversation progresses. This was a grea listen about overcoming personal fears and challenges and learning to live comfortably with things outside of himself he can't control. Thank you Brian for shedding your mask and persona for an hour of insight and inspiration. Here's to your health and the tools that helped guide this far on your journey of self-discovery. Cheers.</p>

<p>I would be grateful to anyone who curbs their opinions and personal feelings about this conversation on this thread. His fans mean a lot to him, and we should all show him the respect and kindness that he shares with others. I read enough of that in youtube comments. It's not difficult to be a decent human being, a little empathy can go a long way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHEERS!</p></p>

        <p>I've been a huge Buckethead fan for years (decades? oy...). This was almost unbelievable to me when I saw this posted on YT a while back. For fans, hearing Bucket speak was limited to a mumble here or whisper there through an open mic and posted on YT, and the source was usually, ultimately, Brian himself, from his friend's vids, or his Young Buckethead vids. Anyhoo, this is awesome. Thanks for posting.</p>
