    <strong>[DOCUMENTARY] Putin: Master of the Game [720p WEBRip | x264 | AAC] [809MB]</strong>
    <p><p>(2018 Deutsche Welle DocFilms)  </p>
<p><strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin is a key figure in world politics. He cultivates his macho image as head of state in office and in his free time. The film analyzes Putin's actions and sheds light on his political and military strategies.</strong>  </p>
<p>Vladimir Putin likes to cultivate a macho image - such as a bare-chested man of action. When he took up his third term as President of the Russian Federation in 2012, he was seen as weak in foreign policy and under political pressure in his own country. Again and again there were massive protests by the opposition. Nevertheless, the former KGB agent had managed to make Russia a relatively stable country after the turmoil of the Yeltsin years, and he has become adept at power play. His goal is to restore Russia's former greatness on the world stage. This documentary shows how he used the Ukrainian crisis, the Syrian war and possibly also cyber manipulation during the US elections. Interviews with former ministers, advisers and diplomats offer a multi-faceted portrait of this enigmatic politician.  </p>
