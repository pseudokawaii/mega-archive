        <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Even with the added precautions the link got taken down within 2 hours :(</p>
<p>Here are 5 more download links to the episode: http://i.imgur.com/oSAQy8A.png</p>
<p>Pasting the links in a text dump site, password protecting the text site, then taking a screen capture of the text site URL with the links + the password to open the text site should hopefully slow the takedowns.
Sorry the hosts aren't mega, but they're all free and fast and you have your pick of what format you want to download the ep in.  Hope these stay up!</p>

<p>Gotcha covered :D</p>
<p>Best quality available; 1080p WEB-DL, and on mega to boot.</p>
<p>I was trying to find this myself and found someone else's upload, so credit to that uploader!  It was behind a bunch of passworded sites and ad sites that required disabling AdBlock to get to the link so I did the dirty work and went through it all to get to the direct link.</p>
<p>The mega links seem to be going down super quick so rather than post the direct link and risk it being taken down I took two levels of precautions; shortened the URL with tinyurl (if you don't trust url shorteners simply add "preview." before the shortened link to see what it is you're getting.  Second level of precaution was to take a screenshot of the actual tinyurl link and post that; it's super short and easy to remember so typing it out from an image should be a breeze and will take you right to the DL link without any ads or catchas or other such nonsense.</p>

<p>Also, screenshots + info from the episode: http://i.imgur.com/0jT5SSE.jpg</p>
<p>Super bummed I can't watch this season of Always Sunny live as it airs; this show is amazing so please support the hell out of them and buy this season on Blu-Ray/DVD/iTunes/whatever whenever it comes out in your country!  &lt;3</p>
