    <strong>[MUSIC] Miles Davis - On the Corner (1972, Japan LP VinylRip 24-96) (Jazz, Fusion, Funk) [FLAC, 1.12GB]</strong>
    <p><p>Vinyl rip of a Japanese LP of Miles Davis' 1972 fusion album <em>On the Corner</em>.  This is one of the weirder albums released by Miles during the first years of his electric period - not as spacious as <em>In A Silent Way</em> or <em>Bitches Brew</em>, and not as rock oriented as <em>Jack Johnson</em>. Instead this album relies heavily on rhythmic texture, with lots of percussion instruments as well as psychedelic guitar effects.  Initially <em>On the Corner</em> was panned by critics, but over the years this album's influence has spread and it is seen in a more positive light.</p>
<p>With <em>On the Corner</em> Miles Davis was attempting to reconnect with a younger audience who were less interested in jazz as it once had been.  Major influences on this album were the groove-based music of Sly &amp; the Family Stone and James Brown, as well as experimental composer/electronic pioneer Karlheinz Stockhausen and the "harmolodics" of jazz saxophonist/composer Ornette Coleman.  Davis himself described this album as "Stockhausen plus funk plus Ornette Coleman."  That said, I would not recommend this album being played at your next dance party unless you want people to look at you funny.</p>
<p>Tracklist:</p>
<p>(Note: originally Side A tracks 1-4, and Side B tracks 2 &amp; 3, were each composed of only a single track.  The creator of this vinyl rip split them separately, but they play back as gapless suites)
<em> Side A1 - On the Corner
</em> Side A2 - New York Girl
<em> Side A3 - Thinkin' One Thing and Doin' Another
</em> Side A4 - Vote for Miles 
<em> Side A5 - Black Satin
</em> Side B1 - One and One
<em> Side B2 - Helen Butte
</em> Side B3 - Mr Freedom X</p>

<p>I will be updating this page once I have uploaded <em>The Complete On the Corner Sessions</em>, a box set which actually covers recordings from 1972-1975.</p>
<p>Enjoy folks, and as always PLAY IT LOUD!</p></p>
