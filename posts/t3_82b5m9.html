<p>As far as I know, there is currently no place to find these. A few years ago I wanted to watch Firefly with my significant other, and while her conversational English is perfect "them jawing in the 'verse have an oddness to them that's gorram confusin'." I was able to get subs from a user on a Firefly forum via a private message. Those subs came from the short time that Firefly was on Japanese Hulu (it hasn't been for years). The ones I received had the opening narration, so I edited a version without the narration. You'll find both versions here.</p>
<p>You won't find this on a DVD or anywhere else, because at least as far as I'm aware, Firefly was only ever released in Japan on Hulu and only for a limited period of time. </p>
<p>I figure there's a very limited audience for this here, but maybe in the future someone will stumble across this when looking for Japanese Firefly subs and it'll brighten their day. </p></p>

        <p>They're pretty boring straightforward translations that really, <em>really</em> simplify the dialogue. I find this to be the case in general with Japanese subtitles of English stuff, but I remember thinking this was particularly bad. Especially since a lot of the charm of Firefly comes from its creative dialogue: None of that creativity and charm survives the translation.</p>
<p>However it does make sure that you're caught up on what's going on at least.</p>

        <p>The same can be said with any translation,  that's why they say "lost in translation", I do like to watch things in their original language weather is French or Japanese,  I understand about 85% of afew languages, the subs are a support. (Not that I know many languages but I manage with about 6 different ones) I can't stand dubs though with some exceptions. </p>

        <p>Right, I'm just saying that when the dialogue is simplified and you're watching House you just get a cliff notes version of medical jargon you probably weren't going to understand anyway. </p>
<p>With Firefly it's like,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>RADIO OPERATOR</strong></p>
<p>English: Sergeant, Command says air support is holding till they can assess our status.</p>
<p>Japanese: 援軍はまだ待機中だそうです</p>
<p>Translation: I hear that reinforcements are still waiting. </p>
<p><strong>MAL</strong></p>
<p>English: Our status is that we need some gorram air support. Now get back on line and tell 'em to get in here.</p>
<p>Japanese: 援軍が来なければ全滅だぞ</p>
<p>Translation: If reinforcements don't come we will be annihilated. </p>
<p><strong>ZOE</strong></p>
<p>English: That skiff is shredding us, sir.</p>
<p>Japanese: 敵が迫ってます</p>
<p>Translation: The enemy is coming.</p>
<p><strong>RADIO OPERATOR</strong></p>
<p>English: They won't move without a lieutenant's authorization code, sir.</p>
<p>Japanese: 上官の命令待ちだとか</p>
<p>Translation: They are waiting for orders from a superior. </p>
<p><strong>MAL</strong></p>
<p>English: Here, here's your code. You're Lieutenant Baker. Congratulations on your promotion. Now get me some air support!</p>
<p>Japanese: この中尉の承認番号で命令できる</p>
<p>Translation: With this lieutenant's authorization code you can give the order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yeah, that happens to one degree or another with most things like this, but it is particularly sad with Firefly given how much the dialogue lends to the character of the show. </p>

        <p>Totally agree, that's why it is good to watch things in the original language as much as possible, sometimes dubs do justice to the original language but it is a rare thing to find a good dub, I've found that with subs, usually fansubs are better than big company ones imo, specially with ANIME, specially those old groups like ANBU, Aone and LiveEviL. Firefly is such a cult that it can be difficult for a non-english speaker to understand why due idioms. </p>
