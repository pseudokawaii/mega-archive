        <p>If you're still looking, it's on eMule, perfect quality. </p>
<p>But the movie itself is quite... disappointing? I dunno, definitely not as realistic as claimed. Especially in the way the whole story is constructed.</p>

        <p>I understand. And I agree about Schindler.</p>
<p>A better way to put it: for me, this was the most grim, emotionally draining film I have ever seen. It is a great film, for sure, but deeply disturbing.</p>

        <p>So I've seen the film.</p>
<p>Think 'overrated' is the right word. I get what the people behind it wanted to show (great camera work, btw) but I just didn't buy the story, at all. There were two powerful moments - the opening scene and then later with the transport in the forest. Other than that - meh. Saul's surroundings were not realistic at all, he had way too much freedom to do whatever he wanted, especially considering the fact he was directly endangering the lives of everyone around him in the process.</p>

        <p>For me, the plot line and characters were secondary. It was the suspension of disbelief they achieved. The over the shoulder perspective of the camera made us one of the prisoners, and unlike you, apparently, I bought the realism of the environment. And it shocked me ... transported me. Saul was suicidally reckless, as he had become drained of hope. So I didn't see it as "freedom to do what he wanted" as much as the lack of a basic fear that normally prevents people from taking foolish risk. </p>
<p>Not that it is always the hallmark of a great film, but it did win the 2015 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.</p>

<p>No, I get that. What I meant was he had way too much luck and got way too much help from the outside, from other prisoners, even after he almost completely jeopardised their conspiracy plans. He definitely got at least one person killed, and you could argue that what happened to them at the end (at least purely in the context of the story) was partly because of his insistence to carry that body with him no matter what. I just found all of this incredibly hard to believe.</p>
